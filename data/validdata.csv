I'd find a way to believe that it's all true  
Knowing that you lied straight-faced while I cried  
Still I look to find a reason to believe  
  
Someone like you makes it hard to live without  
Somebody else  
Someone like you makes it easy to give  
Never think about myself  
  
If I gave you time to change my mind  
I'd find a way just to leave the past behind  
Knowing that you lied straight-faced while I cried  
Still I look to find a reason to believe  
  
If I listened long enough to you  
I'd find a way to believe that it's all true

5988,Fastball,Human Torch,/f/fastball/human+torch_20053175.html,"Turned 'round 6 o'clock and I'm still sleepin'  
I don't have to work on Saturday  
But I do anyway  
'Round the corner right on up to the shop  
I come creeping, but it don't matter anyway  
  
'Cause I know it's just as well  
And even so I feel like hell  
You can say that it's alright  
But I am wrapped up tight  
And I can see the forest through the trees  
I am on my knees  
I don't know if I am supposed to stay  
Or I'm supposed to leave it all behind  
  
The door the world outside still spins  
Waiting there behind the door but I won't let it in  
Not today, not tomorrow, not next week  
You're just gonna have to pay five bucks to see the geek  
  
'Cause I know it's just as well  
And even so I feel like hell  
You can say that it's alright  
But I am wrapped up tight  
And I can see the forest through the trees  
I am on my knees  
I don't know if I am supposed to stay  
Or I'm supposed to leave it all behind  
  
Please pay your attention high above the center ring  
Up in the rafters, 500 feet above the crowd  
My hair is soaked in kerosene  
My clothes are wet with gasoline  
You only get to see this once  
The human torch is going down  
Going down, going down, going down

You were there with me

Just by walking away  
Playing like we used to play  
Our kingdom will never go away  
Feel you beating in my chest  
I'll be dead without

For want of the price of tea and a slice

21469,Who,Dreaming From The Waist,/w/who/dreaming+from+the+waist_20146586.html,"I feel like I want to break out of the house  
My heart is a-pumping, I've got sand in my mouth  
I feel like I'm heading up to a cardiac arrest  
I want to scream in the night, I want a manifest  
  
I've got that wide awake, give-and-take, five o'clock-in-the-morning feeling  
I've got the hots for the sluts in the well thumbed pages of a magazine  
I want to drive, want to fly like I do in the dreams I've never really been in  
I want to hump, want to jump, want to heat up, cool down in a dream machine  
  
I'm dreaming... from the waist on down  
I'm dreaming... but I feel tired and bound  
I'm dreaming... of a day when a cold shower helps my health  
I'm dreaming... dreaming - of the day I can control myself  
Day I can control myself  
  
Sound like a priest and then I'm shooting dice  
I'm burning tires with some guy whose hair is turning white  
I know the girls that I pass, they just ain't impressed  
I'm too old to give up, but too young to rest  
  
I've got that numb-to-a-thumb over-dubbed  
Feeling social when the world is sleeping  
The plot starts to thicken then I sicken and I feel I'm cemented down  
I'm so juiced that the whorey lady's sad sad story has me quietly weeping  
But here comes the morning  
Here comes the yawning demented clown  
  
I'm dreaming...but I know it's all hot air  
I'm dreaming...I'll get back to that rocking chair  
I'm dreaming...of the day I can share the wealth  
I'm dreaming...dreaming - of the day I can control myself  
Day I can control myself  
Hey, hey!  
The day I can control myself

I never picked cotton  
But my mother did  
And my brother did  
And my sister did  
And my daddy died young  
Workin' in a coal mine  
  
When I was just a baby  
Too little for a cotton sack  
I played in the dirt  
While others worked  
Til they couldn't straighten their backs  
I made myself a promise  
When I was big enough to run  
That I'd never stay a single day  
In that Oklahoma sun  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Folks said I grew up early  
And that the farm couldn't hold me then so I stole ten bucks  
And a pickup truck  
And I never went back again  
Then it was fast cars and whiskey  
Long haired girls and fun  
I had everything that money could bring  
And I took it with a gun  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It was Saturday night in Memphis  
When a redneck grabbed my shirt  
When he said go back to your cotton sack  
I left him dying in the dirt  
They'll take me in the morning  
To the gallos just outside  
And in the time I got  
There ain't a hell of a lot  
That I can look back on with pride

Sprawled across my big brother's grave  
Shaking and drunk with sleep  
I crawled to my feet and walked up into the shade  
Of a young elm tree that must have been planted since the last we came  
Vicki, my mom, and me, cleaned the dirt  
From the plaque that says his name  
Walking to my girlfriend's car  
Came back down on me  
Yeah, I guess I fell to my knees  
To keep from falling face-first into the dream  
The vision that had had me twisting out under the afternoon sky  
I didn't know it then  
But it was thirteen years to the day he died  
  
He held his hand in me  
Like brothers we walked  
Through the colorless world of an alcohol dream  
I talked for hours  
Trying the break through the silence  
That he held over me  
Then he started away, turned his head  
Keep it up so you can die like me  
  
Ever since my brother odied  
I've drifted all over from town to town to town  
Every place I go it's always the same  
I keep doing junk, I keep going down  
My mama got religion and my sisters gave up  
Man I just gave up too  
I just died inside  
Don't wanna die like george  
Everybody says there's things to see  
Everybody's pointing their fingers at me  
  
I woke up driving  
After another blackout from another bad drug  
I can't shake this hell that I made for myself  
For every other life I took  
See my sister's son walk the line I walked  
He's only sixteen  
If he don't learn from my mistakes  
He's gonna waste away  
He's gonna die like me

Breeding hate

My God, it's been so long  
Please comfort me before I go insane

There was a guy  
An under water guy who controlled the sea  
Got killed by ten million pounds of sludge  
From new york and new jersey  
This monkey's gone to heaven  
  
The creature in the sky  
Got sucked in ahole  
Now there's a hole in the sky  
And the ground's not cold  
And if the ground's not cold  
Everything is gonna burn  
We'll all take turns  
I'll get mine, too  
This monkey's gone to haven

Then the devil is 6 [5x]  
Then God is 7 [3x]

Did you get it right  
  
Headstrong battle song  
Exploding souls be gone

Where did we go wrong

Nar'on ka na, bakit pa humanap ng iba  
Ngayon ikaw ang pinapangarap  
Pinanghihinayangan ko ang lahat  
  
Bakit ba ang pagsisisi laging nasa huli  
Ang mga lumipas ay di na maaaring balikan  
  
Refrain:  
Sayang bakit ako nag-alinlangan pa  
Tuloy ngayo'y lumuluha at nanghihinayang  
  
Koro:  
Kung maibabalik ko lang,  
Ang dati mong pagmamahal  
Pagka-iingatan ko at aalagaan,  
Kung maibabalik ko lang,  
Ang dating ikot nang mundo  
Ang gusto ko ako'y  
Lagi na lang sa piling mo

He gazed at Killarney with rapturous smile  
""How can I buy it?"" he said to his guide  
""I'll tell you how"" with a smile he replied.  
  
How can you buy all the stars in the skies?  
How can you buy two blue Irish eyes?  
How can you purchase a fond mother's sighs?  
How can you buy Killarney?  
  
Nature bestowed all her gifts with a smile  
The emerald, the shamrock, the Blarney.  
When you can buy all these wonderful things  
Then you can buy Killarney.

I had to take my Christmas,  
In my overall.  
But now she gone,  
And I don't worry.  
Because I'm sitting  
On top of the world.  
  
Goin' down to the freight yard,  
Just to meet a freight train.  
I'm gonna leave this town,

You wanted me to see you change your name  
I couldn't stand to see you wed another  
But dear I hope you're happy just the same  
  
Wedding bells are ringing in the chapel  
That should be ringing out for you and me  
Down the aisle with someone else you're walking  
Those wedding bells will never ring for me  
  
I planned a little cottage in the valley  
I even bought a little band of gold  
I thought some day I'd place it on your finger  
But now the future looks so dark and cold  
  
Wedding bells are ringing in the chapel  
I hear the children laughing out with glee  
At home alone I hang my head in sorrow  
Those wedding bells will never ring for me  
  
I fancy that I see a bunch of roses  
A blossom from an orange tree in your hair  
And while the organ plays I love you truly  
Please let me pretend that I am there  
  
Wedding bells are ringing in the chapel  
Ever since the day you set me free  
I knew someday that you would wed another  
But wedding bells will never ring for me.

So I get out of bed put on my shoes and in my head  
Thoughts fly back to the breakup  
These four walls are closing in  
Look what a fix you put me in  
  
Since you've been gone  
Since you've been gone  
I'm out of my head, can't take it  
Could I be wrong  
But since you've been gone  
You've got the spell so break it

Since you've been gone  
  
So in the night I stand beneath the backstreet light  
I read the words that you sent to me  
I can take the afternoon, the night time comes around too soon  
You don't know what you mean to me  
Your poison letter, your telegram  
Just goes to show you don't give a damn

Don't look down, it's an impossible view  
Spread your wings, aerial  
  
[Lupe Fiasco]  
Head to the sky, wings raised in  
She's about to fly and take her place in  
Out there in the stars, when she leaves the ground  
She'll see a broken heart, if she turns around  
But aint no going back, this is how it must be  
He told her, she'll be burned alive  
She just told him trust me  
If funerals are beautiful, this ugly  
Knowing she told her you'll leave me if you loved me  
And he knows that, because he knows her  
Hard to hide his feeling's as it engulfs her  
Now she's a bright blaze, light rays  
A shooting out Phoenix on fire buring up the night scape  
So lets hear it for our heroine, applaud as our spirits fly into the never end  
One closed chapter, it opens up another part  
So this is more like, the end, question mark (question mark, question mark)

I only hold you back  
We on a dead-end street, this block has got a cul-de-sac  
So fly baby, my baby, so high, sometimes it's so hard to say bye  
We made it from the alley straight up to ballet  
We pulled up to the valet, we'll teach our daughter ballet  
We'll raise us a Beyonce, maybe she'll be a Halle  
You woulda been the best mom  
I would have been the best 'Ye  
You see it all in my veins, like varicose  
I know that's very gross but we getting very close  
To our end, though I killed most with a pen  
Soon as this flow end, I'ma let Mos begin

What do you mean, me go  
Why can't it be, we go  
What happens when people turn to tears  
Dreams turn to memories  
And weeks turn to years  
Huh? Standing in the same spot for a couple of weeks  
Give me my feelings back, wish it came with a couple reciepts  
Man, our vacation was coming next week  
Girl I swear you was a trip, lets make it a couples retreat (do it)  
How cud my girl do this to me  
Woke up sayin no, the World did this to me  
Now I'm testing one two  
Reportin live from the rubble  
Drinking all I can so I can turn to fire when I hug you  
One, two, three, four, five models on the double  
Give me head all at once look like they line in a huddle  
But it's not even half the feeling as hearing you shine  
She know I love ya, shedding tears everyday  
And I'm tired of lying in these puddles  
I ask ""Y"" sometimes like a f-cking vowel  
But hitting tree's everyday like a f-cking owl  
Trying to get high enough to cut the clouds  
Caught the Phoenix Sun to Nash it out, I mean ash it out.  
So I could see you smile  
  
I-I know you can see me now

33491,Genesis,The Day The Light Went Out,/g/genesis/the+day+the+light+went+out_20058927.html,"When they went to bed that night, no one would have believed  
That in the morning light would not be there  
The dark hung heavy on the air like the grip of a jealous man  
No place was there known to have been spared  
Then panic took control of minds as fear hit everyone  
The day the light went out of the daytime sky  
  
Artificial light could hardly penetrate the gloom  
Nothing out of reach could be observed  
Looting, pillage, murder, rape became the rule of that day  
Who hit him no one knew, or whom he hit  
Cars were caught in pileups and the planes could never land  
The day the light went out of the daytime sky  
  
""Now I can rest here after my journey  
Now I can feed here before I continue.""  
  
Some were there who's heads were clear who sought, tried to find  
The nature of this deadly foe, the dark  
It seemed the sun was still somewhere, though hidden from their sight  
By something, though amorphous, yet alive  
And so they looked for ways to rid themselves of the parasite  
The day the light went out of the daytime sky  
  
""Now I can rest here after my journey  
Now I can feed here before I continue.""  
  
They tried in many fruitless ways to see the noonday sun  
By blasting with their missiles through the dark  
But soon a kind of sleepy state came over everyone  
Till nothing seemed to stir or even breathe  
And when the darkness chose to disappear, not many had survived  
Then came a shadow - another had arrived  
And again the light went out of the daytime sky

Alright boys  
Well the sun is gonna shine in my back door some  
My back door some, my door someday  
You know the sun is gonna shine in  
My back door some day  
That big wind is gonna come up and blow my blues away  
Now if you don't want me baby  
Now why don't you tell me  
Now why don't you tell me, tell me so  
If you don't want me baby why don't you tell me so  
It ain't like I'm a woman who ain't got no place to go  
Play it right now  
Now what good is a bulldog, if he won't fuss or  
He won't fuss or fight pretty baby  
What good is a bulldog, if he won't fuss or fight.  
And what good is a man can't make his wolf stay all night

I touch your hair, I kiss your skin,  
And hope the morning sun won't wake you too soon.  
For when you wake, and look at me,  
You never know, you just might see,  
Another boy who crept in your room...  
Take your time...(that's what you told me),  
Take your time...  
But I fell head first, and I just don't know what to do.  
  
Chorus:  
Nothing looks the same in the light,  
Only a fool like me would take to heart,  
The things you said you meant last night.  
Nothing looks the same in the light,  
I'll keep my feet firm on the ground.  
Nothing looks the same in the light,  
There's danger in a stranger,  
With a warm hand and a kiss so right.  
Nothing looks the same in the light,  
It's been a pleasure, - see you around...  
  
I watch the sun, upon the sheets.  
I hear a car, out on the street,  
And gently pull you close, it's over too soon.  
What can I do, but wait and see,  
Hold on to you, please stay with me,  
Because you're the first, and I want to stay here with you.

It just fills my head with garbage that my eyes ain't supposed to see  
Got the turned off T.V. blues now, but I'm lonely as you see  
  
Well I've got a worried feeling, all the pain and misery  
Well, it's happening in the world now, even though I cannot see  
Though my body is now with you, still my mind is running free  
  
There's just nothing I can do now, though I search from day to day  
But the truth is so hard to tell you, and you know it, anyway  
It's a cold and winter's evening, I wish my blues would go away

Down Skid Row only black men can go

And you set my soul at ease.  
Then you let your love abound,  
And you bring me to my knees.  
  
Oh, it's evil, babe, the way you let your grace enrapture me.  
When well you know, I'd be insane  
To ever let that dirty game recapture me.  
You made me a Shadowboxer, baby.  
  
I want to be ready for what you do.  
I've been swinging all around me  
""'Cause I don't know when you're gonna make your move.  
Oh, your gaze is dangerous.  
  
And you fill your space so sweet.  
If I let you get to close,  
You'll set your spell on me.  
So darlin', I just want to say  
  
Just in case I don't come through,  
I was on to every play  
I just wanted you.  
Oh, it's so evil, my love.  
  
The way you've no reverence to my concern.  
So I'll be sure to stay wary of you, love.  
To save the pain  
Of once my flame, and twice my burn.

The sun comes out  
Last night was shaking  
And pretty loud  
My kitty is purring  
And scratches my skin  
So what is wrong  
With another sin  
The bitch is hungry  
She needs to tell  
So give her inches  
And feed her well  
More days to come  
New places to go  
I've got to leave  
It's time for a show  
  
Here I am, rock you like a hurricane  
Here I am, rock you like a hurricane  
  
My body is burning  
It starts to shout  
Desire is coming  
It breaks out loud  
Lust is in cages  
Till storm breaks loose  
Just have to make it  
With someone I choose  
The night is calling  
I have to go  
The wolf is hungry  
He runs the show  
He's licking his lips  
He's ready to win  
On the hunt tonight  
For love at first sting  
  
Here I am, rock you like a hurricane  
Here I am, rock you like a hurricane  
Here I am, rock you like a hurricane  
Here I am, rock you like a hurricane...

You give me hope, to carry on.  
You light up my days  
And fill my nights with song.

Could it be finally, I'm turning for home  
Finally a chance to say, ""hey, I love you""  
Never again to be all alone.

Nowhere to turn but the inward light  
Because life is for believing  
That your heart can turn to gold  
All you need is Christ to receive it  
There's eternal life for every soul  
  
Rosemary your day will come  
He loved you so He gave His only son  
Keep the faith in your soul  
Stay down on your knees  
I'm begging you please  
Hold onto the beads at your heart  
  
He loves you He needs you He wants you  
So don't let Him down

No, I can't forget tomorrow  
When I think of all my sorrows  
When I had you there but then I let you go  
And now it's only fair that I should let you know  
What you should know

That I ain't had no liquor on my breathe  
Ain't no kinda' secret, I've been known to take a drink  
And it's made me do some things that I regret  
  
Loretta said this ain't no kind of way to raise a family  
And one night she called it quits and called a cab  
She left her clothes out on the clothes line  
And the dishes in the sink  
So I guess she knows that she ain't coming back  
  
Well I just want to see my kids  
I just want to hold my girls  
Heaven knows I ain't got much of nothing else in this ole world  
I just want to be around enough to know that they've been loved  
I just want to be their daddy, my daddy never was  
  
Now lately she's been knowin' this old boy she met in church  
And I can't say she's wrong for wanting more  
I gave him the right to tell my wife that I can't come around  
The night I knocked a hole in her front door  
  
And Loretta took my keys and she made me wait outside  
But she didn't call the law she called a cab  
And as I pulled away I saw something in her eyes  
So I reckon that she knows I ain't so bad  
  
I just want to see my kids  
I just want to hold my girls  
Heaven knows I ain't got much of nothing else in this ole world  
I just want to be around enough to know that they've been loved  
I just want to be their daddy, my daddy never was

In the shade of the old ivy wall

For some splendid beauty tips, pay attention listen to me.  
  
White is beautiful dear ladies, smear your face with paint of lead,  
Never mind the lead had made the men who mixed it I'll or dead.  
  
Take some silk of red or black, cut a circle or a cresent,  
Stick it on your face to cover, smallpox scars, it's much more pleasant.  
  
Shave your eyebrows, clean away, take a trap and catch some mice,  
Make false eyebrows with the mouse skin, stick them on, you'll look so  
Nice.  
  
Next you need a monster wig, if you want to look real smashing,  
Once your wig has reached the roof, then you'll be the height of fashion.  
  
Decorate your lovely hairpiece, use the feathers of a parrot,  
Add some ribbon, fruit and flowers, from your ear then hang a carrot.  
  
Make your face look soft and chubby, pack your mouth with balls of cork,  
Hang your flash teeth in the middle, hope you don't choke when you talk.  
  
Now you followed my advice, last of all you need a fan,  
Flutter it oh so demurely, then your sure to bag your man.

Packing your bags, being slow and thorough

What's my life like nigga its a constant grind  
You got seven eight or nine you can push on  
Cause I'm a selfish nigga I want 10 strong  
Oh no it happened again  
Let me get a good flow of that dro again  
Got phone blowin' up like a high school bell  
Plus the price sky rocket like dope in jail  
Break it down in small portions fuck sellin' a O  
You'd rather make seven or eight or cock bound for da 4  
I'm a hustla far from being a busta nigga  
You got good game but still don't trust ya nigga  
You can catch me in the neighborhood winter or summer  
Spring or fall cause nigga I be selling it all  
From junts to blunts blunts to bags and bags to O's  
O's to pounds I'm just holding it down

I got 36 ounces blocked up pure yola  
Make it times 2 once I hit it with the soda  
Whip it up good in a beacon and a blender  
Have it rock hard plus white as December  
I switch up my raps yo I never go the same way  
Plus I get a different prepaid every 30 days  
So if I get jam I know where it came from  
Rub my shit suitable never serve unusual  
All money ain't good and all money ain't fine  
Some money come with blood and some money come with time  
Some money can't spend and some money ain't safe  
Money in the wrong way I'll lead you to the wrong place

I got 8 or 9 paints and a bottle of kay row  
And I wouldn't give a fuck if you nod or stay woke  
I just got back from the N Y C 250 a paint  
Back in Memphis Tenn with drank  
50 a ounce after I done added the bounce  
45 get the nine and every dollar gone count  
I'm a hustla' don't make me say it again  
I ain't trying to please a nigga I'm trying to stack some ends  
The strong survive while the weak slowly dying  
I'm congruent to them boys I'm out there slanging them pies  
They never stop trying they never give up they gotta succeed  
My life is like the saying nigga crack speed or weed

The shit can't be there  
You woke me up just to check that I'm alive  
We talk to each other as if we're five  
Raise open the flag just to see which of us cares  
And they're digging up the roads  
And widening it just so  
You can suffocate at home  
Alright, right  
Alright, alright, alright, alright

With the residue stuck deep down in your teeth

With a fit on Crip, don't trip

I'm fiending, daydreaming of the times when I had  
Much mota, many different kinds in the bag  
I fell hard for the funk, I can't fake the love  
I smoke dro, good Reggie, smoke shake to nugs  
If it's weed, then I'm with it

Got a blunt? Let me split it down the gut

My body tingles, I feel so strange,  
I feel so tired, I feel so drained,  
And I'm wondering if I'll ever be the same again,  
Is this in limbo or in Heaven or Hell?  
Maybe I'm going down there as well,  
I can't accept my soul will drift forever.  
I feel myself floating back down to Earth,  
So could this be the hour of my rebirth?  
Or have I died or will I wake from dreaming?

Yesterday's moments I remember  
It's the bleak street,week kneed partings I recall  
It's the mistier mists the hazier days  
The brighter sun and the easier lays  
There's all the more reason for laughing and crying  
When you're younger and life isn't to hard at all  
  
It's the fantastic drowse  
Of the afternoon Sundays  
That bored you to rages of tears  
The unending pleadings  
To waste all your good times  
In thoughts of your middle-aged years  
It's the vertical hold all the things that you're told  
For the everyday hero it all turns to zero  
And there's all the more reason  
For living or dying when you're young  
And your troubles are all very small  
  
Out here on the street we'd gather and meet  
And scuff up the sidewalk  
With endlessly restless feet  
Half on the time we'd broaden our minds  
More in the pool hall  
Than we did in the school hall  
With the down town chewing gum bums  
Watching the night life the lights and the fun  
  
Never wanted to be the boy next door  
Always thought I'd be something more  
But it ain't easy for a small town boy  
It ain't easy at all  
Thinkin' it right and doin' it wrong  
It's easier from an arm chair

Like a gentle cobweb hanging upon a painted tepee  
Oh I went to see my chieftain with my warlance and my woman  
For he told us that the yellow moon would very soon be leaving  
This I can't believe I said, I can't believe our warlord's dead  
Oh he would not leave the chosen ones to the buzzards and the soldiers guns  
  
Oh great father of the Iroquois ever since I was young  
I've read the writing of the smoke and breast fed on the sound of drums  
I've learned to hurl the tomahawk and ride a painted pony wild  
To run the gauntlet of the Sioux, to make a chieftain's daughter mine  
  
And now you ask that I should watch  
The red man's race be slowly crushed  
What kind of words are these to hear  
From Yellow Dog whom white man fears  
  
I take only what is mine Lord, my pony, my squaw, and my child  
I can't stay to see you die along with my tribe's pride  
I go to search for the yellow moon and the fathers of our sons  
Where the red sun sinks in the hills of gold and the healing waters run  
  
Trampling down the prairie rose leaving hoof tracks in the sand  
Those who wish to follow me I welcome with my hands  
I heard from passing renegades Geronimo was dead  
He'd been laying down his weapons when they filled him full of lead  
  
Now there seems no reason why I should carry on  
In this land that once was my land I can't find a home  
It's lonely and it's quiet and the horse soldiers are coming  
And I think it's time I strung my bow and ceased my senseless running  
For soon I'll find the yellow moon along with my loved ones  
Where the buffaloes graze in clover fields without the sound of guns  
  
And the red sun sinks at last into the hills of gold  
And peace to this young warrior comes with a bullet hole

And in early fall when brown leaves fall, I'll catch a glimpse of you  
Should you go first and I remain, for battles to be fought  
Each thing you've touched along the way, will be a hallowed spot  
I'll hear your voice I'll see your smile though blindly I may grope  
The memory of your helping hand will buoy me on with hope  
Beyond the sunset, oh blissful morning  
When with our savior, heaven is begun  
Earth's toiling ended, oh glory dawning  
Beyond the sunset when day is done  
Should you go first and I remain, to finish with the scroll  
No lessening shadows shall ever creep in to make this life seem droll  
We've known so much of happiness, we've had our cup of joy  
And memory is one gift of God that death cannot destroy  
I want to know each step you take that I may walk the same  
For someday down that lonely road, you'll hear me call your name  
Should you go first and I remain, one thing I'll have you do  
Walk slowly down that long long path, for soon I'll follow you  
In that fair homeland, we'll know no parting

I see your lips your summer kisses  
The sunburned hands I used to know  
Um since you went away  
The days grow long  
And soon I'll hear old winter's song  
Oh, but I'll miss you most of all  
My darling when autumn leaves  
Start to fall  
Oh I said I miss you most of all  
My darling when autumn leaves  
Start to fall

Hold up, hold up, hold up  
Ain't donuts ain't no coffee  
See ya, know ya see me calling and calling  
I should crack ya right in ya forehead  
  
Let me take a breathe (Let me take a breathe)  
And regain my composure  
Told you one more time (Told you one more time)  
If you f'd up it's over.  
When it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone

So just scoo do do doot baby

It's a wrap for you boy (It's a wrap)  
Oh baby  
  
If I ever misrepresented my self-image  
Then I'm sorry  
I was oh so acquiescent  
But I learn my lesson  
Boy you sorry  
Buh buh buh  
All out in the open  
Don't make me go call Maury Povich  
  
Let me take a breathe (Let me take a breathe)

It's going down like a denominator  
Trying to keep holding on, holding on  
Boy let me go  
You go wake my neighbors, get away from my door  
That was your last shot you ain't coming back  
It's the martini I mean it baby  
It's wrap  
  
When it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone  
You dead wrong, so wrong, so wrong, so wrong, so wrong (you dead wrong)

Good year for hunters and Christmas parties  
And I hate and I hate and I hate  
And I hate elevator music  
The way we fight  
The way I'm left here silent  
  
Oh these little earthquakes  
Here we go again  
These little earthquakes  
Doesn't take much to rip us into pieces  
  
We danced in graveyards with vampires till dawn  
We laughed in the faces of king never afraid to burn  
And I hate and I hate and I hate  
And I hate disintegration  
Watching us wither  
Black winged roses that safely changed their color  
  
Oh these little earthquakes  
Here we go again  
These little earthquakes  
Doesn't take much to rip us into pieces  
  
I can't reach you  
I can't reach you  
  
Give me life  
Give me pain  
Give me myself again

Here we go again  
These little earthquakes  
Doesn't take much to rip us into pieces  
Doesn't take much to rip us into pieces

I sit beside our bed  
Watching you sleeping so sweetly  
I'm almost completely out of my head  
Every breath you breathe  
Is a work of art  
Everytime you sigh just breaks my heart  
There's no one in this whole world  
Inspires me the way that you do  
Undying admiration  
Undying admiration  
I'll sing it to the night  
I'll sing until the light  
Undying admiration  
  
And when the morning comes  
And a little child appears  
Hearing the love in your laughter  
Sometimes I just have to hold back the tears  
  
The passion on your face  
The depth of your soul  
Would inspire any muse to lose control  
There's no one in this whole world  
That teaches me the way that you do  
  
Undying admiration  
Undying admiration  
I'll write it on the sky  
And tell the world of my  
Undying admiration  
  
All my life I've waited for  
The kind of love  
Keats and Shelley would be jealous of  
And it's you baby  
You made it all come true baby  
Oh, oh  
  
Undying admiration  
Undying admiration  
I'll write it on the sky  
And tell the world of my  
Undying admiration

Somewhere this life isn't crazy

It's not when the singer's alone  
At the end of a song  
  
[Chorus]  
At the end of a song  
There's no one  
After the last note is played  
Only the memory stays  
Then even that fades away  
And there's nothing so hard  
As convincing your heart  
That you should start singing again  
  
You told me  
Nothing could change perfect lovers  
But like every promise you made  
It broke before long  
  
It's lonely  
Falling away from each other  
But we've come to the last of your words  
And the end of a song

Nothing to do it's up to you

Good morning, good morning  
  
Going to work don't want to go feeling low down  
Heading for home you start to roam then you're in town  
Everybody knows there's nothing doing  
Everything is closed it's like a ruin  
Everyone you see is half asleep.  
And you're on your own you're in the street.  
  
After a while you start to smile now you feel cool  
Then you decide to take a walk by the old school.  
Nothing had changed it's still the same  
I've got nothing to say but it's ok  
Good morning, good morning  
  
People running round it's five o'clock  
Everywhere in town is getting dark  
Everyone you see is full of life.  
It's time for tea and meet the wife  
Somebody needs to know the time, glad that I'm here.  
  
Watching the skirts you start to flirt now you're in gear.  
Go to show you hope she goes.

The place was such a reck  
I couldn't reach the bathroom  
Thought Id better clear the deck  
I tried to call the lawyer  
And ask him what to do  
He referred me to his doctor  
Who referred me back to you  
And when you checked the manual  
You kept in side the case  
It said put it in a cool dry place  
  
I drove around the city  
Looking for a room  
That was high above the water  
Where my things could be in tune  
There was no one to help me  
Nobody even cared  
I had to got through hell  
To get those things up there  
I paid my first subscription  
Then I joined the idle race  
And they said store it in a cool dry place  
  
I got guitar, basses, amplifiers and drums  
Accordions and mandolis and things that sometimes hum  
Cymbals and harmonicas, capos by the score  
And lots of things in boxes laying all around the floor  
  
Some places they get mildew  
And others get too hot  
Some places are so damp that  
Everything you got just rots  
All kinds of condensation  
Directories of the rain  
Theres not much compensation  
When everythings been stained  
Some have sentimental value that  
Cannot be erased  
Go store it in a cool dry place  
  
We got solids and acoustics  
And some from flowered board  
And some are trimmed in leather  
And some are made with gourds  
Theres organs and trombones  
And reverbs we can use  
Lots of dx-7s  
And old athletic shoes  
I bought a great big building  
It took up one whole block  
I made an inventory  
Of all the things in stock  
The place was getting longer  
I was up all night  
I used up all my pencils  
But I went onto spite  
The blury of my vision  
The sweat upon my face  
I've got to put this stuff away  
I mustnt leave a trace  
The landlords breathing down my neck  
He says its a disgrace  
So I said put it in a cool, dry, place.

Touching your hand my heart beat much faster  
All that I want in all of this world is you.  
  
You are the promised kiss of springtime  
That makes the lonely winter seem long  
You are the breathless hush of evening  
That trembles on the brink of a lovely song.  
You are the angel glow that lights the star,  
The dearest things I know are what you are.  
Someday my happy arms will hold you,  
And someday I'll know that moment divine  
When all the things you are, are mine.

To watch the news on tv  
I saw some ordinary slaughter  
I saw some routine atrocity  
My father said, don't look away  
You got to be strong, you got to be bold, now  
He said, that in the end it is beauty  
That is going to save the world, now  
  
And she moves among the sparrows  
And she floats upon the breeze  
She moves among the flowers  
She moves something deep inside of me  
  
I was walking around the flower show like a leper  
Coming down with some kind of nervous hysteria  
When I saw you standing there, green eyes, black hair  
Up against the pink and purple wisteria  
You said, hey, nature boy, are you looking at me  
With some unrighteous intention?  
My knees went weak,  
I couldn't speak, I was having thoughts  
That were not in my best interests to mention  
  
And she moves among the flowers  
And she floats upon the smoke  
She moves among the shadows  
She moves me with just one little look  
  
You took me back to your place  
And dressed me up in a deep sea diver's suit  
You played the patriot, you raised the flag  
And I stood at full salute  
Later on we smoked a pipe that struck me dumb  
And made it impossible to speak  
As you closed in, in slow motion,  
Quoting Sappho, in the original Greek  
  
She moves among the shadows  
She floats upon the breeze  
She moves among the candles  
And we moved through the days  
And through the years  
  
Years passed by, we were walking by the sea  
Half delirious  
You smiled at me and said, Babe  
I think this thing is getting kind of serious  
You pointed at something and said  
Have you ever seen such a beautiful thing?  
It was then that I broke down  
It was then that you lifted me up again  
  
She moves among the sparrows  
And she walks across the sea  
She moves among the flowers  
And she moves something deep inside of me  
  
She moves among the sparrows  
And she floats upon the breeze  
She moves among the flowers  
And she moves right up close to me

A heart full of joy and gladness  
Will always banish sadness and strife

I want to be your shadow  
The mystery's gone  
So bring back the sun  
We'll bury this hate  
And build it with love  
The grass wasn't greener  
I found  
I wanted you to know  
I dug you up a rainbow  
I know, I know I failed you  
I hope, I hope we get to  
Sunny days again

There is an anger comes off this girl,  
That she can't find an origin,  
The things I plant won't grow,  
Yet the wild weeds flower in wind and snow.  
Nothing to be nothing to prove,  
Nowhere to go nothing to lose.  
When will my season come,  
Was I born of infertile soil,  
Is my seed without song,  
Can I not see the woods for these forests in my head,  
Can I not see the sunlight as I play dead?  
Nothing to be nothing to prove,  
Nowhere to go nothing to lose.

I've got troubles that would make you scream and shout  
Don't tell me your troubles  
I've got troubles I will tell you all about  
No I don't take a drink, no I won't take a drink  
But I sure take some ups and some downs  
You makes me so weary  
You pick me up to put me down  
Don't tell me your troubles  
I've got troubles that would make you scream and shout  
Don't tell me your troubles  
I've got troubles I will tell you all about  
No I don't take a drink, no I won't take a drink  
But I sure take some ups and some downs  
You makes me so weary  
You pick it up and put me down  
You never have to worry and you never have to try  
You're never in a hurry and I know the reason why  
You got your Daddie's and your fingers in some pies  
You makes a double of a trouble with your lies  
  
You say, Oh I'm mad about the boy  
You say, Oh-oh-oh I'm mad about the boy  
You say, Oh I'm mad about the boy

Just like you knew I wouldn't do  
Cry, cry for you  
Just like a song in the last light  
  
Should I leave it all away  
Not like the kindness that you gave  
That's why it never seems the same  
Behind your eyes  
  
I stood behind when no one asked me  
And took you home after the fight  
I drove my car into city lights  
Drove down the road that I am on  
  
Cry, cry for you  
That's what you think I want to be  
Cry, cry for you  
An empty heart that sees me through  
  
Cry, cry for you  
Just like you knew I wouldn't do  
Cry cry for you  
Just like a song in the last light  
  
Cry, cry for you  
Just like you knew I wouldn't do

Laughing in my face  
Here within my troubled sleep  
There's such a lonely place  
Running fast but never moving  
I can't get away  
Strange but realistic objects  
Making me their prey  
  
Then it's gone as fast as it came  
Evil dream  
Changing like the sun turn to rain  
It would seem  
  
La la la la la  
  
Dining with the gods of beauty  
On a distant shore  
Tasting fruits of untold sweetness  
Never seen before  
Dancing stars with crystal voices  
Beckon with their eyes  
Unicorn of many colours  
Rides to paradise  
  
Then it's gone as fast as it came  
Peaceful scene  
Changing like the sun turns to rain  
It would seem  
  
La la la la la  
  
Sleepless nights that last a lifetime  
Crucify my head  
Dreams of peace and then disaster  
Wish that I were dead  
Looking for the end of darkness  
Seeking out the day  
For escape with speed unthought of  
Bearing me away  
  
Then it's gone as fast as it came  
Peaceful scene  
Changing like the sun turns to rain  
It would seem  
  
La la la la la  
  
Come into my dream

Candy lies  
Candy lies

I felt a force  
You called it dark

Why don't you  
Stay awhile  
Stay awhile

Your dragon needs slaying  
Won't you lay here with me

Kisses for the beast  
  
Lay here with me  
Here with me

Documents and pages  
Ancient savageries  
  
Christened those inflated.  
Now it has come to light  
The Gods they have slipped up  
  
They forgot about the power  
Of a woman's love  
Just stay a while  
Stay awhile  
  
Stay awhile  
Why don't you  
Stay awhile  
Stay awhile  
  
Stay awhile

If your running from yourself

As you jump to the street below  
But where can you go  
To leave yourself behind  
Alone in the spotlight  
Of this, your own tragedy  
  
I give you my love, love, love  
Love, love, love, love, love, love...

In the heart of the city

And I'll bring you through  
See your not alone
