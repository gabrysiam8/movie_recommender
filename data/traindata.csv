27316,Cher,Heart Of Stone,/c/cher/heart+of+stone_20029731.html,"Beneath the white fire of the moon  
Love's wings are broken all too soon  
We never learn  
Hurt together, hurt alone  
Don't you sometimes  
  
Wish your heart was a heart of stone  
We turn the wheel, and break the chain  
Put steel to steel, and laugh at pain  
We're dreamers in castle's made of sand  
The road to Eden's overgrown  
  
Don't you sometimes  
Wish your heart was a heart of stone  
Look at the headlines  
Big crowd at the crazy house  
Long cue for the joker's shoe  
Ten rounds in the ring with love  
Do you lose and win  
  
Or win and lose  
Sweet rain, like mercy in the night  
(Lay me down, wash away the sorrow)  
Caress my soul and set it right  
(Lay me down, show me your tomorrow)  
Summer tears, winter and the moment's flown  
  
Don't you sometimes  
Wish your heart was a heart of stone  
Mercy, mercy, wish your heart was a heart of stone  
  
Get the picture  
No room for the innocent  
Peak season in lonely town  
Knocked out of the ring by love  
Are you down and up  
  
Or up and down  
I ask the river for a sign  
(In a dream, we go on together)  
How long is love supposed to shine  
(In a dream, diamonds are forever  
But you and I, hurt together, hurt alone  
  
Don't you sometimes  
Wish you heart was a heart of stone  
Mercy, mercy, wish your heart was a heart of stone  
(With a heart of stone, you'll be well protected)  
  
Don't you sometimes  
Wish your heart was made of stone  
(With a heart of stone, you'll be well connected)

I'm not too good at leavin' time  
I got no taste for grievin' time, no, no, not me  
You've been my near ones, always my dear ones  
I never thought that I would find  
Another love, a different kind but it came to be  
Well, if you think I'm tellin' you lies  
Go try your luck and look into her eyes  
But remember, you must remember she's mine  
And my world overhead has a clear new shine  
Don't want to leave you, sorry to grieve you  
It's travelin' time and I must move on  
Found the girl to lean upon  
And if I could arrange it  
Would I care to change it? Not me

As I lay and wait to die  
Little do they know  
That I hear their choice of life  
  
End it now, it is the only way  
Too cruel, that is what they say  
Release me from this lonely world  
There is no hope - Why don't you  
  
Pull the plug  
Let me pass away  
Pull the plug  
Don't want to life this way  
  
Once I had full control of my life  
I now behold a machine decides my fate  
End it now it's all to late  
  
What has now been days, it seems like years  
To stay like this is what I fear  
Life ends so fast, so take your chance  
And make it last  
  
End it now, it is the only way  
Too cruel, that is what they say  
Release me from this lonely world  
There is no hope - Why don't you  
  
Pull the plug  
Let me pass away  
Pull the plug  
Don't want to life this way

You don't try and see  
The white is too dull  
We need the reds and the greens  
You're big time now  
On new york tv  
A prime time fool  
For everyone to see  
  
Can't see a heaven  
Is the sky isn't clear  
You can't change a mind  
If it doesn't want to here  
  
Will we ever get out of here  
Lets stop and think awhile  
Another time another place  
Where everyone smiles  
  
You have the rights  
Or you seem to think  
Stopped dead in their tracks  
Other peoples dreams  
  
All those ideas  
Questioned by doubt  
I'm telling you man  
You'd better get out  
  
Can't stop the dance  
If the song isn't done  
You can't stop the change  
Outnumbered 100 to 1  
  
You don't understand  
You don't try and see  
You're in the cage and  
We've got the key  
  
Can't see the future 'til  
Its in front of you  
But you can't escape it

Never saw it coming, what a surprise  
It's been a wonder  
Electricity tells a story  
  
It's a sound getting near as fear is watching you  
It's watching you close  
You can fight it, both arms swinging  
Or try to wash it away  
  
Or pay up to the echoes of 'okay'  
No more, no more will I see you  
No more will I see you  
No more will I see you  
  
You've schemed more than you have  
You've borrowed more than you know  
Better to steal the crumbs  
It makes it easier to go  
  
Paralyzed by conscience  
Looking for an opening  
Apathy as your vocal cords cut out  
Never thought once to ask how's the temperature  
  
Too busy with the finer points  
Of each struggle we're after  
No more, no more will I see you  
No more will I see you  
  
No more will I see you  
So long since I've seen you  
Haven't we both been living the high life  
It flows to the bottom  
  
No more, no more will I see you  
No more will I see you  
No more will I see you

Of a now late afternoon,  
As the sun shines through the curtained lace  
And shadows wash the room.  
And we sit and drink our coffee  
Couched in our indifference,  
Like shells upon the shore  
You can hear the ocean roar  
In The Dangling Conversation  
And the superficial sighs,  
The borders of our lives.  
  
And you read your Emily Dickinson,  
And I my Robert Frost,  
And we note our place with bookmarkers  
That measure what we've lost.  
Like a poem poorly written  
We are verses out of rhythm,  
Couplets out of rhyme,  
In syncopated time  
And The Dangling Conversation  
And the superficial sighs  
Are the borders of our lives.  
  
Yes we speak of things that matter,  
With words that must be said,  
""Can analysis be worthwhile?""  
""Is the theater really dead?""  
And how the room is softly faded  
And I only kiss your shadow,  
I cannot feel your hand,  
You're a stranger now unto me  
Lost in The Dangling Conversation  
And the superficial sighs  
In the borders of our lives.

And our popular points of view

Or something or anything  
'Cause we can't say ""I love you""  
  
I hurt you  
'Cause you hurt me

And fake ass playas get a real playa hatin' 'em  
Honey Love goes platinum and y'all ass come around  
But y'all don't want to raise the roof  
Until my shit is going down  
  
And now you hear my songs the radio is bangin'  
Oh I can't believe my ears  
And what everybody's sayin'

I would give it all up, just to take one ride

How I used to hoop off in them tournaments  
(With you)  
And how I used to club hop on weekends  
(With you)  
Your family called the morning of the tragic end  
Damn, my condolences  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Voices in my head be telling me to come to church  
Said the Lord is the only way for you to stop the hurt  
Dreaming of windows black tinted like a hearse  
When waking up to life sometimes seems worst  
And all I ever wanted is to be a better man  
And I try to keep it real with my homies now  
For me to save the world I don't understand  
How did I become the leader of a billion men?  
  
And now you hear my songs the radio is bangin'  
Oh I can't believe my ears  
And what everybody's sayin'  
Boy I'll tell you, folks don't know the half  
I would give it all up, just to take one ride  
  
(With you)  
How I used to street perform on Friday  
(With you)  
And how I used to go to church on Easter Sunday  
(With you)  
Standing here throwing them songs at me  
Somebody pray for me  
  
[Repeat: x3]  
I wish that I could hold you now  
I wish that I could touch you now  
I wish that I could talk to you  
Be with you somehow  
I know you're in a better place  
Even though I can't see your face  
I know you're smiling down on me  
Saying everything's okay

Now things weren't the same  
You were talking at me not with me

Are you coming back?

When Monday comes you'll be alone  
With the whole world staring at you

I rolled a fat blunt and yo, it ripped this way  
I took a puff (uh-huh) and what did I see?  
Those motherfuckers still want to I-see-E  
To blaze up a sac of that green bombay  
And when I reach my peak, I explode like dante  
Tha ganjay has got my mind wide open, I'm soakin'  
In the music, I use it, And don't abuse it  
And true, It gets me high like the sky  
I will buy till the day that I die  
You ain't gotta ask me why  
I take tokes from the smoke, I can't deny  
Got a lifetime supply

And I want to get you high  
Get you high all night  
'cause I want to get you high  
Get you high all night  
And I want to get you high

This is a zig zag story that I had last night  
A six-pack, a joint, And I was feeling all right  
Lit up tha chronic, And what did I see?  
This bad-ass bitch creeping up on me  
She had the look that could get the ice cooked up in a second  
I pictured her undressing and gettin' butt-naked  
She walked up to me and said her name was mary jane  
Ain't no shame in my game, Down to do anything  
Took me by the hand, Ask me if i'd like to fly  
You know I like to fly  
[Chorus]  
[Verse 3]  
Now here's a zig zag story that I'm havin' right now  
Gotta get myself together, Cause some shit is goin' down  
Hit you people off with my new cd  
Hard to swallow, Like saying ""fuck the industry!""  
I'm stompin' through the bayou with my black boots laced  
And takin' out you motherfuckers acting two-faced  
For the people out there gonna blaze 'till I die  
Blaze up the thai

The sun so hot and the roses so red where she lie  
As little boys sit and watch as she twirls all around  
Sunny smiles not a raincloud could bring that girl down  
But now...  
  
What's behind those big brown eyes  
Do you dream at night  
Without your lullaby  
  
Little boy sits alone as he sings in the dark  
Wondering if his own dreams had pulled them apart  
He sings a song of tomorrow he never can see  
Mostly sings of a lost little girl's memory  
And now...  
  
As his dreams go flashing by  
He begins to hear  
A lonely lullaby  
  
Well now...  
We used to sing  
And we used to cry  
Through everything  
In our children's lullaby  
  
Little girl on the street with nobody around  
Has her head in the air dirty feet on the ground  
She shuts her eyes and wonders if this is a mistake  
Now she's gone from the warmth of her little boy days  
And still...  
  
She believes that she'll get by  
On her own without  
Her little boy's lullaby  
  
Little boy prays to God to answer his song  
To hold her hand when everyone else's are gone  
Time goes by and the wounds slowly turn into scars  
So he makes his final wish on the midnight stars  
And he screams...  
  
Little girl won't you hear my cry  
Won't you come back home  
To your lover's lullaby  
  
Little girl down by the waterside  
Goodbye

A fool and gold must part  
But in this hectic world the biggest fool's the joker  
Who gambles with his heart, Lord-Lord, who gambles with his heart  
One last time guitar  
  
And that's the story of a gambler's guitar...

Greeks:  
In 776BC Olympics were begun  
Greece was the only country, so naturally we won  
Cheats built bronzes of God Zeus were we honest winners  
The answer's no we had more statues than you've had hot dinners  
Our games meant truce was called in war a peace every 4 years  
But wrestling was so violent that bouts could end in tears  
No girls allowed to watch or run that might sound rude  
But makes sense when I tell you we competed nude  
  
[Chorus]  
FLAME  
It's gonna burn forever  
Love for Olympic heroes  
FLAME  
We'd like one next however  
Sadly it's Emperor Nero  
Hey watch it you two, alright  
  
[Verse 2]  
Emperor Nero:  
I went from Rome to Greece so I could play them at their games  
In 67AD you know I won Olympic fame  
Told them to include a contest based on poetry  
Not much good for sportsmen no, but brilliant for me  
Crashed my racing chariot but still awarded gold  
Hey my Olympics my rules  
To argue would be bold  
I won every medal that was up for grabs  
The crowd loved it well they had to or I would have had them stabbed, OK?  
  
[Chorus]  
Greeks:  
FLAME  
  
Nero:  
Olympic champion that's me  
My games were emperors own round  
  
Greeks:  
FLAME  
  
Nero:  
Think I was bad in 393  
Christian Rome had them banned  
  
[Hook]  
all:  
It's over, it's over, it's over, it's over, it's over, it's over  
  
Nero:  
  
SHAME  
  
[Verse 3]  
Baron de Coubertin:  
WAIT not so fast  
  
I'm Baron de Coubertin, a famous French historian  
I read of the Olympic Games thought I should try restoring them  
They'd be just like the old days I said but did propose  
That unlike Greeks Victorians should do them wearing clothes  
In 1896 we launched the games in dear old Greece  
Hoped it would make men more morale as well as less obese  
We built a stadium so we could start to play  
Games of the modern Olympics which we still have today  
  
[Chorus]  
All:  
FLAME  
  
Baron de Coubertin:  
I'm on my personal glory  
But no-one remembers my name  
  
All:  
FLAME  
  
Baron de Coubertin:  
So here to finish our story  
A man who has gold plated fame  
  
[Verse 4]  
Jesse Owens:  
I'm Jesse Owens fastest man in 1936  
I took home 4 gold medals yeah, but that's just the basics  
What you should know about the fact I was victorious  
Is, it made Herr Hitler mad ha it made him furious  
Hitler said Berlin should be the games Germanic base  
So he could show the world Aryans were the master race  
I won in 4 events he had to back pedal  
His evil theory destroyed with every medal  
  
[Chorus]  
All:  
FLAME  
It's gonna burn forever  
Olympics are never in doubt  
FLAME  
A fire of sporting endeavour  
You realise it's actually gone out  
Olympic, Olympic  
FLAME

His arms didn't move except when the wind cut up  
Rough and mice ran around on the ground  
He stood in a field where barley grows.

Waiting for the time, to take away your life.

Then left town

When a fella walked up and said

Uhh, this verse starts as my snipers hit their marks  
And ya guards fall down from a rifle to the heart  
Like clap clap, let em fall slow  
I know you had you fears you can let them all go  
And most women are motivated so I act accordingly  
But this is so refreshing that it means a little more to me  
Dedicating time when I really can't afford to be  
I provide protection if you open up the door for me  
Couple stares, couple texts, couple dates  
Couple 'i think that we're ready's'  
Couple 'i think we should wait's'  
Are we acting like a couple, I'm just trying to get it straight  
Cause I'm over here convinced that it's too early for mistakes  
  
[Jhene Aiko - Chorus]  
You had to change up the game  
Oh the weather is not the same  
Now there's only cloudy days  
I can't stand the rain in July  
Oh July  
There were fireworks exploding (exploding)  
But now it's getting colder  
The leafs are turning colours  
Why, it's just not our season  
The one and only reason  
Baby oh baby oh  
When summer turn into fall  
  
[Drake - Verse 2]  
Damn, tell me where did all the magic go  
I follow all the rules and told you everything you had to know  
Had you over every night, every night was passionate  
Plus you met my mother even if it was an accident  
I'm confused tell me where we go wrong  
I wish shorty I would be with you so long  
I was planning on being something worth mentioning  
Energy invested in someone I saw potential in  
Who killed Chivalry they need to get their sentencing  
Meanwhile we argue and I can't get a sentence in  
And just as I predicted here we go again  
They always say the hottest love has the coldest end  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[Jhene Aiko]  
See it's funny cause I never thought this would end but then the season
changed  
[Drake]  
You are my, you are my, you are my girl (I was your girl)  
Shoulda made, shoulda made, shoulda made you my World  
Shoulda made you everything to make you happy baby  
[Jhene Aiko]  
Can't wait for, can't wait for, can't wait for springtime  
And I will turn into a butterfly  
I will spread my wings and fly  
And I'm too fly for the sh-t  
Ohhh, I am Japanese if you please

Construction time again  
What is it this time  
We're laying a pipeline  
  
Let the beads of sweat flow  
Until the ends have met through  
Could take a long time  
Working on the pipeline  
  
Taking from the greedy  
Giving to the needy  
  
On this golden day  
Work's been sent our way  
That could last a lifetime  
Working on the pipeline  
  
From the heart of our land  
To the mouth of the man  
Must reach him sometime  
We're laying a pipeline  
  
Taking from the greedy  
Giving to the needy

But you're still here  
All you need is me

You bang your head against the wall  
And say you're sick of it all  
Yet, you remain  
'Cause all you need is me  
  
And then you offer your one and only joke  
And ask me ""What will I be,  
When I grow up to be a man""?  
  
Me? Nothing!  
  
There's a soft voice  
Singing in your head  
Who can this be?  
I do believe it's me  
  
There's a naked man standing  
Laughing in your dreams  
You know who it is  
But you don't like what it means  
  
There's so much destruction  
All over the world  
And all you can do is complain about me

There was only one thing I ever dreamed about  
Fate has just handed it to me

Carpet-baggers bluff and strike  
Kiss of Judas, spider like  
  
Waiting like jackals to sneak up and trick you  
Wolves in sheeps clothing, slow death in consoling  
Lurking in shadows, they pounce least expected

She's a modern girl in a modern world  
Where only the strong can survive.  
Too many dreams have been laid at her door,  
But the modern girl will ride on, oh oh oh.  
  
Where would you fit in the scheme of her day  
And where could you fit in her heart?  
Trying to be small will get you nowhere at all,  
But the modern girl will ride on, oh oh oh.  
  
Don't throw your love away.  
Don't throw your love away.  
Don't throw your love away.  
Don't throw your love away.  
  
She moves through your life like a warm summer breeze,  
And nothing will stand in her way.  
The sound of her voice brings your heart to its knees,  
But the modern girl will ride on, oh oh oh.

For all the things I've done to make you worry  
And all the time I cared for you from the bottom of my heart

I will be yours if you'll be mine  
I will be there 'til the end of time  
I will be with you until the day that I die  
I'll be yours, I will be yours  
  
I've been around the world  
And seen a lot of girls  
But no one can compare to you

That you belong to me  
Cause you're the only one I need

When the monster hums  
People think a nuclear war is at their front door  
When I got my volume only on four  
(gas pipes explode) and the storefronts shatter  
Killing these kilowatts is all that matter  
Fuck the police, the citizens, and (fuck the judge)

Vibrational booms drying up the lagoons  
My bumps pop fake titties and melt ice grills  
Relocate your piercings (dissolve your pills)  
Police wail on they sirens but I blow they tweeters  
Illuminated liquid leaking outta my speakers  
Each drop burns all the way down to the earth's core

Crows and ravens don't flap they wing  
They just float on the waves that the humdrum brings

A single inch of me to something I can't see,

Would you even make the eyes?  
I don't believe my ears,  
And I'm scared of my own head,

I'll make you raise me from the dead,

But lying's all I've learned,

No music,  
And I can talk about anything  
Whether or not it's worthwhile  
Is based on who's listening,  
Most of us listening for something we can relate to,  
All of us related for something we just been through,  
Taken for granted trust is damaged and now we panic,  
Livin empty-handed living lives like we can manage,  
I can feel you but still know where home is feeling like Jonah did,  
Almost dropped the bat like every base was fully loaded,  
So be concerned (x2)  
  
I am disappearing  
Inside my birds-eye theories,  
I try to say goodbye, defy and deny,  
What it is I'm fearing  
Clearly I am dying,  
Dearly I am writing,  
Merely testifying that a test to fly requires  
I pass the test with colors flying,  
I don't believe you most the time,  
I'm lying 'cause I say I am fine,  
You are the pearl, I am the swine,  
So break my life and take this rhyme,  
I'm so sorry but I do believe  
That all my bridges I have burned,  
And I've earned a policy of no return,

Told her, ""My favorite room in here's the kitchen, (In the kitchen)  
After I whip all these chickens  
I watch you get naked and wash all these dishes"", (Wash all these dishes,

She licked me, she fucked me, she sucked me  
Then tried to give me a kiss, bitch you tripping (Huh?)  
She wanna hit my muddy trouble double  
Told that bitch, ""Pour your own muddy trouble""  
I shouldn't have fucked her, now she's in her feelings, (What?)  
Shawty broke down and start telling her business  
I said to lil' mama, ""You tripping

To all that feel no love appeal no more,  
So how can I break this wall around you,

And we can dream tomorrow,  
Save our hearts for care and loving too,

Don't go and break this fragile heart.

Destroy what comes tomorrow,

Yet so much more to gain,  
And if I could choose the world around me,  
The world I choose would all revolve around you,  
So help me complete the game inside me,

I thought that he walked on water.  
  
He said he was a cowboy when he was young.  
He could handle a rope and he was good with a gun.  
And my mama's daddy was his oldest son,  
And I thought that he walked on water.

If the story's told, only heaven knows.  
But his hat seemed to me like an old halo.  
And although his wings, they were never seen.  
I thought that he walked on water.  
  
Then he tied a cord to the end of a mop,  
And said, ""son, here's a pony, keep her at a trot.""  
And I'd ride in circles while he laughed a lot.  
Then I'd flop down beside him.  
  
And he was ninety years old in sixty-three  
And I loved him and he loved me.  
And lord, I cried the day he died,  
  
Cause I thought that he walked on water.

Feel the pulse of human blood pouring forth  
See the stems of Europe bend under force

All quiet on the Western Front  
  
So tired of this garden's grief, nobody cares  
Old kin kiss the small white cross, their only souvenir  
See the Prussian offense fly, weren't we grand  
To place the feel of cold sharp steel in their hands

Ghosts float in a flooded trench as Germany dies  
Fever reaps the flowers of France, fair-haired boys  
String the harps to Victory's voice, joyous noise

Everyday reminded how much I hate it  
Weighted against the consequences  
Can't live without it, so it's senseless  
Wanna cut it out of my soul  
And just live with a gaping hole  
Take control of my life and wash out all the burnt taste  
I made the problems in the first place  
Hang my head low 'cause it's part of me  
You hardly see it right next to the heart of me  
Heard of me, the routine scar  
New cuts cover where the old ones are

Once it's been dealt with you feel like  
You've been touched by something angelic  
And then melted down into a pool of peace  
Cease to be the animal you used to be  
Remove the broken parts you know were wrong  
And feel the calm when the problem's all gone  
And then you start to see another piece  
Of yourself that you can't let be  
Memories of the last fight to free yourself  
Take it to the depths of the bottom of the well  
And now you know that you can choose  
To lose the part in your heart where your insides bruise  
You can live if you're willing to  
Put a stop to just what's killing you  
Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me  
Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me  
Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me  
Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me

A part of me screams away silently

And I know you sent me some,  
But I was waiting  
For the miracle, for the miracle to come.  
I know you really loved me.  
But, you see, my hands were tied.  
I know it must have hurt you,  
It must have hurt your pride  
To have to stand beneath my window  
With your bugle and your drum,  
And me I'm up there waiting  
For the miracle, for the miracle to come.  
  
Ah I don't believe you'd like it,  
You wouldn't like it here.  
There ain't no entertainment  
And the judgments are severe.

But it sounds like bubble gum  
When you're waiting  
For the miracle, for the miracle to come.

I haven't been this happy  
Since the end of World War II.

From your fingers and your thumb,  
And you were waiting  
For the miracle, for the miracle to come  
  
Ah baby, let's get married,  
We've been alone too long.  
Let's be alone together.  
Let's see if we're that strong.  
Yeah let's do something crazy,  
Something absolutely wrong  
While we're waiting  
For the miracle, for the miracle to come.  
  
Nothing left to do  
  
When you've fallen on the highway  
And you're lying in the rain,  
And they ask you how you're doing  
Of course you'll say you can't complain  
If you're squeezed for information,  
That's when you've got to play it dumb  
You just say you're out there waiting  
For the miracle, for the miracle to come.

Down until the dawn,  
I'll keep watch until I'm sure your coming home.

Something could be terribly wrong.  
  
Don't be careless love,  
Don't be careless love,  
Don't be, don't be careless.  
  
In my dream you're running nowhere  
Every step you've taken turns to glue,  
Walking down a spiral staircase  
Failing through, failing through,  
  
Don't be careless love,  
Be careless love.  
  
The lamp burns down and out  
I'm getting pretty tired of this,  
I feel so bad something might be going amiss,

You're getting in deep whatever you do,  
Don't let me go back to sleep,  
  
Don't be careless love,  
Don't be careless love,  
Don't be, don't be careless.  
  
Saw your face in the morning paper,  
Saw your body rolled up in a rug  
Chopped up into two little pieces  
By some thug,  
  
Don't be careless love,  
Be careless love.  
But in the morning light  
When I wake up again  
You're by my side and that's the way it's always been,  
But in the dark your mind plays funny tricks on you,  
Your mind plays funny tricks on you,  
Your mind plays funny tricks on you,

We drifted apart

Turned night into day  
I need you to stay

Closer than your next of kin

And the seed of everything  
  
And if your world has turned to ashes  
I will leave you never  
Even when the sun's blown out, I will shine forever  
I caress you with my charms

I'm the light that guides you through the nights  
And deepest haze

You need a friend without a doubt  
I wonder why you came around  
Are you awake or do you dream  
You're stuck inside a frozen scene  
You try to move but there's no moves  
You try to speak but there's no use  
You try to wake but you can't  
You close your eyes without a chance  
You need a friend without a doubt  
I wonder why you came around..

42918,Marillion,Story From A Thin Wall,/m/marillion/story+from+a+thin+wall_20328997.html,"I heard the battle raging on the other side of the wall  
Buried my head in a pillow and tried to ignore it all  
Every night when I hear you, I dream of breaking down your door  
An avenging knight in shining armor to rescue you from it all  
From the family business  
  
When I see you in the supermarket  
With sunglasses in the shade  
Averting your eyes from the staring questions  
How were those bruises made  
It's family business  
  
Children clutching to your legs  
They've got so much they want to say  
But daddy's sitting home drunk again  
So they bite their lips and pray  
  
And daddy don't like no strangers prying  
And noses in his private affairs  
And if anyone asks from the social  
Well, you fell down the stairs  
It's family business  
  
So I'll become an accessory  
And I don't have an alibi  
To the victim lying on my doorstep  
The only way I could justify  
It's family business  
  
'Cause every day it's getting harder  
Try to see, to go away  
To all the people that surround you  
You have to sit down and explain  
  
To be the writing on the wall inside  
To be the pledge you call your own  
And if you run into the day  
You sure, you know you'll find a home  
You sure, you know you'll find a home  
  
The traffic lights shine upon  
And the broken home  
Everyone could be so far away  
And the white lines lead the way  
  
The writing on the wall  
They're carving out the martyrs  
  
Could've been the same this way  
Could've been the same this way  
Tell them I'm the same today  
We could have been much younger  
It could have been much longer  
  
Until the real time too far  
You run away today  
Tomorrow, you take away the time  
You took away a mind  
  
Something to the light she said  
Everyone's burning  
We could have been much younger

You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall  
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do

[Verse 2:]  
Check, the verses I'm writing you might wanna learn it  
You hatin my song but your wife wanna burn it  
So now you at the store for some blank cds  
You can't see me, for your sake might wanna return it  
Cause, if you bring them discs home to ya girl, she'll forget you  
And I'll be the only one she concerned with  
To the people that ignored me before this  
This one is for you as a song re-recorded  
Funny thing is, you just notice me now but I was here along  
Your vision's just been distorted  
I'm so [?] I live this, you ask me what the business  
And I write a sixteen and record it, uh  
The waiting is over I think music need it  
Drake cuttin his records without gettin weeded  
People in the South want it chopped and screwed, I got this dude  
They expectations Imma exceed it uh  
Like a singer with only backgrounds ya'll record it  
When it's done ya lyrics tend to mislead ish  
Finally here Imma star with the timing  
My swagger is chill, and my flow is reclining  
This for anybody that's searchin for cash, a purchase [?]  
You only get the dough when you grindin  
And so I grind like I'm listening to I Wayne  
My pain, you can experience through the rhyming boy!

But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do  
Do's what you do, I do what I do  
  
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall  
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball

He seemed so glad to see me  
I just smiled  
And we talked about some old times  
And we drank ourselves some beers  
Still crazy after all these years  
Oh still crazy after all these years  
  
I'm not the kind of girl who tends to socialize  
I seem to lean on old familiar ways  
And I ain't no fool for love songs  
That whisper in my ears  
Still crazy after all these years  
Still crazy after all these years  
(Crazy, I'm gonna crazy, I'm gonna crazy)  
  
Four in the morning, crashed out, yawning  
Longing my life away  
I'll never worry  
Why should I?  
It's all gonna fade  
  
Now I sit by my window  
And I watch the cars  
I fear I'll do some damage one fine day  
But I would not be convicted by a jury of my peers  
Still crazy after all these years  
Oh, still crazy  
(Baby I'm crazy through all these years)  
Still crazy  
Still crazy after all these years

Too cynical to speak

Our twentieth century bitch and we are grateful for our

And I'll kiss you, between the ears,

Swirl me around your room with feeling,  
And as we twirl, the glow in the dark stars on your ceiling,  
Will shine for us,  
As love sweeps over the room,

With my twenty-two it's hot with little pops  
Started bustin' off shots aimin' all at the sky  
I emptied out the gun bustin' all at the sky  
Then I went and stole the bow and arrow from my dad  
To the arrow tips I tied gasoline soaked rags  
Climbed up with the Zippo, lit 'em off in the sky  
A trail of black smoke leading off in the sky  
I bought some Chinese stars from the Kung-Fu surplus  
They had 'em under the glass, I made the purchase  
Climbed up and I whizzed 'em off in the sky  
  
Even stood up on the chimney, whizzed 'em off in the sky  
Then I found a double barrel with shells at Wal-Mart  
I threw it in next to the Faygo in my shopping cart  
I got home, climbed up and blew it off in the sky  
3:20 in the morning, bustin' off at the sky  
I got a blow gun too, a real one at that  
I dip the tips in poison, lay up on my back  
And now they're piercing through the air straight up into the sky  
  
It's like the only thing you hear is into the sky  
I bought a harpoon off the Internet and went up  
And tried to shoot it but the fuckin' rip off, it got stuck  
I said ""fuck it"" and I threw the spear up into the sky  
As fuckin' hard as I could, I threw it into the sky  
I'm sprayin' mace up there, I throw M-80s up there  
I'm shootin' everything I got, I sit and wait in my chair  
Because I hate the sky above, whether moon or sun  
Whether rain or snow, since the pain begun  
  
I'm tryin' to aim for the Heavens up into the sky  
Tell me why the love of my life had to die?  
How's she gonna leave me and not even say bye?  
I know that she's an angel and they're lettin' her fly  
Every plan I thought we made together was a lie  
She could of hung on, I bet she didn't even try  
She left me dry, and that no one can deny  
And when she fall from the sky, I'm askin' her why

Angels are falling!  
Falling angels!

sound a lot like Jimmy Buffet because we live in Key West and use Congo drums
in our songs. For all those people that live in Key West and are under the
misconception that Mr. Buffet live in Key West and we'd like to say there's a
lot of things in Key West, as a matter of fact, there's

There's sailboats and conk shells and palm trees galore,  
But Jimmy Buffet doesn't live in Key West anymore

Verse 1:  
Hey smugglers need those Buffet songs, snitching on the sly  
Bringing heat where it's already to damn hot to die  
Son of a son of bitch, what's all that bullshit for  
Jimmy Buffet doesn't' live in Key West anymore  
  
Verse 2  
Sailing to the Caribbean Jimmy might well be  
Pictures up in Rollin' Stone for all the world to see  
The rich keep getting richer, the poor they just stay poor  
Jimmy buffet doesn't' live in Key West anymore  
  
Verse 3  
Now Jimmy's moved to Malibu with all those other stars  
He's not down at in Duval Street hangin' out in bars  
All them God damned tourist, got to be a bore.  
Jimmy Buffet doesn't live here any more  
  
Verse 4  
So don't tell me I sound like Jimmy Buffet  
Just because I got that island beat  
Jimmy might have grown up on the ocean  
Me, I kinda grown up on the street  
Music's just a way of life, me I'm liv'in free  
Don't lay all that Key West Jimmy Buffet shit on me  
Verse 5  
Now Divers Do It Deeper must have really made them mad  
Some of them reviewers said it really sounded bad  
Well they liked Margaritaville, me I liked it too  
Someday Jimmy, why don't we just both get drunk and screw  
Oh those creepy Mother Fuckers that think music is a whore  
Tell that you just don't live in Key West anymore

He sits and stares through the backdoor screen.  
And all the news just repeats itself  
Like some forgotten dream  
That we've both seen.  
  
Someday i'll go and call up judy.  
We worked together at the factory.  
Ah, but what would I say when she asks what's new?  
Say, ""nothing, what's with you?  
Nothing much to do. ""  
  
You know that old trees just grow stronger,  
And old rivers grow wilder every day,  
Ah, but old people, they just grow lonesome  
Waiting for someone to say,  
""hello in there. hello.""  
  
So if you're walking down the street sometime  
And you should spot some hollow ancient eyes,  
Don't you pass them by and stare  
As if you didn't care.  
Say, ""hello in there. hello.""

But it seems we have lost the power  
Any tiny step of advancement  
Is like a raindrop falling into the ocean -  
We're running on the spot - always have - always will?  
We're just the next generation of the emotionally crippled.  
Though we keep piling up the building blocks  
The structure never seems to get any higher  
Because we keep kicking out the foundations  
And stand useless while our lives fall down.  
I believe in life - and I believe in love  
But the world in which I live in - keeps trying to prove me wrong.  
  
Out in the pastures we call society  
You can't see further than the bottom of your glass  
Only young but easily shocked  
You get all violent when the boat gets rocked -  
  
Just like sheep - little lambs into the slaughter  
Don't fully grasp what exactly is wrong -  
Truth is you never cared - still -  
You get all violent when the boat gets rocked -  
  
Intelligence should be our first weapon  
And stop reveling in rejection  
And follow yourselves, not some ageing drain brain  
Whose quite content to go on feeding you garbage  
We're running on the spot - always have - always will?  
We're just the next generation of the emotionally crippled.

9595,John Prine,John Prine Christmas,/j/john+prine/john+prine+christmas_20074812.html,"Pretty paper  
Pretty ribbons of blue.  
  
Man oh man,  
I just love Christmas it's just so darn neat.  
I kinda wish every day was Christmas,  
Except Christmas eve and the Fourth of July.  
We wouldn't want to miss out on the fireworks, would we?  
When I was a kid, we used to get the Christmas catalog from Montgomery Wards
in Chicago.  
Sometimes we'd get it as early as late August.  
It was the big book of wishes, hopes and desires.  
My three brothers and I were allotted twenty-five bucks a piece, including
tax.  
  
So I'd make up a different Christmas list every night  
From the first of September 'til the twenty-forth of December.  
Matter of fact, let me present you with my Christmas credentials.  
When I was three years old, at least that's what my mother told me,  
I ate an entire ornament. I ate a big red one, I thought it was an apple.  
They kinda freaked out and was gonna take me to the hospital  
But they couldn't stop me from laughing so they just left me alone.  
So I guess I still got that Christmas in me all the time, you know?  
  
One year, I got a wooden Roly-Poly for Christmas,  
You know the things you knock down and they bounce right back up.  
They made 'em out of wood back then, that's how old I am.  
Nowadays, they make 'em out of plastic.  
My mom says, ""They just don't make 'em like that anymore.""  
And I says, ""No ma, they don't"".  
  
Then there was the year I came home only eave from the army,  
From Germany to marry my high school sweetheart on the day after Christmas.  
My little brother Billy, who was twelve at the time,  
Had just gotten his first job so he was able to afford to buy some Christmas
presents  
For his brothers and his mom and dad out of his own pocket.  
Billy had a job selling subscriptions for the Chicago Tribune.  
He told me this guy named Rocky would pick him up in a station wagon,  
Him and some other boys, and he'd take 'em out to some strange neighborhood  
And drop 'em off and he gave them this whole spiel to give their potential
customers.  
Supposedly their little brother had won a free trip to our nation's capital
Washington, D.C.,  
But he couldn't go on the trip if his older brother wouldn't accompany him  
So if you would please buy a subscription to the Chicago Tribune  
Then my little brother will be happy.  
Wow, what a shyster! Some people'll do anything to get to the Whitehouse.  
  
Then there was the year that my mom and dad gave me my first guitar.  
Ah man it was gorgeous, I still got the thing.  
It was a like aqua blue.  
Kinda dark aqua blue with a cream colored heart.  
Was a Silvertone from Montgomery Wards.  
The model was called Kentucky Blue  
And man when I saw that sitting under the tree I just couldn't wait.  
First year so I didn't know how to play it,  
I'd just stand in front of the mirror with a string  
Around my neck with that guitar and I'd try to look like Elvis.  
Then my brother Dave taught me a couple of chords,  
Now I'm here in your living room singing and talking to you.  
It's funny how things work out.  
  
So-a whyn't you go find a stranger and extend your hand to 'em.  
If you see somebody looks like  
They ain't doin' quite as well as you, slip 'em a buck,  
'specially if they don't ask for spare change.  
Go buy your honey a cuckoo clock or a musical snow shaking water ball,  
That when you wind it up it plays,  
""I want you, I need you, I love ya with all my heart.""  
'cause after all, hell man, it's Christmas.  
  
Away in a manger no crib for a bed.  
The little Lord Jesus lay down his sweet head.  
The stars in the sky look down where he lay.  
The little Lord Jesus asleep on the (1-2) hay.  
  
Merry Christmas Everybody.

Don't you know that I love you?  
Why'd you make me feel bad?  
'Cause the only thing I ever loved  
Was loving you.  
  
So you think you are something special  
I wonder why, baby, is that so  
Could admit, you are something special  
Won't you tell me, girl? I'd love to know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So you think you are something special...  
  
What makes you think you are something special?

Audrey was a girl that sat in my classroom  
She never said a word  
She just sat there furtively  
I never noticed her until I heard the radio  
Telling about the way she took her life  
Today it's all upon the covers of the papers  
About her folk at home  
I guess her daddy's a drinker  
Her mommy left her  
When she was just a little child  
Oh tell me Audrey, was it the first time  
You felt abounding ness  
  
Hold on baby  
Don't be sorry  
Every day has it's ups and downs  
Hold on baby  
There will be sunshine  
Every life has it's stormy nights  
  
Comes to think about it  
There is some things that can't be called  
About her arms  
They had blue spots on them  
I remember to think  
It starts to myself  
Is it wrong to wonder about somebody else problems  
I'm not burning with at all  
  
Hold on baby,...  
...that she lays down on the bottoms of the river  
Tell me what crime did it take  
To take this girls only willingness  
But I will pray  
That someday, she'll rise again!  
  
If you're out there  
I hope you can see my sorrow  
And pain of guilt  
I never asked you how you were  
But one thing I can assure you  
After witnessing what is been done  
I will open my heart to the new girl  
That sits next door!  
Hold on baby,...

His eyes are raging and his burning lungs are steaming

Feel love like anyone  
No one knows that black dog better than I  
I said no one knows that black dog better than I  
  
When I see his running I can see me  
Teeth in the collar and he's tearing it free  
Spit out the leather and the cold studs that kept you from singing  
Run till you're bleeding run till you're hot  
till the memory of all this you've long since forgot  
Run till forever till the bells of your freedom are ringing

I fell in love with you  
But then  
Everything went wrong  
I couldn't even write a song  
There was nothing to look forward to  
I don't go out very much  
I'm always home on my own  
Baby, I was just too blind to see  
I wanted to conquer the world  
But the world had a mind of its own  
Maybe I tried a little too hard  
Maybe I pushed you away too far  
Got a room in your heart for a lonely heart  
Got a room in your heart for two  
It might be nice  
Living in a heart with you  
So sing and all the world will shine  
Somewhere in this nursery rhyme  
A happy ending lies  
For all the lovers with the lonely eyes  
Easy come, easy go  
This is just to let you know  
Baby, I apologize  
How could I turn away love?  
How could I turn into stone?  
How could I turn my back on you?  
I wanted to be a success  
But success ever leaves you alone  
Maybe I tried a little too hard  
Maybe I pushed you way too far  
Got a room in your heart for a lonely heart  
Got a room in your heart for two  
It might be nice  
Living in a heart with you

I walked through the country  
I walked through the town

And I didn't look down

The answer's always ""aye""  
The best view of all

Your friends they aren't at home  
Everybody's gone to the garden  
As you look into the trees  
You can look but you don't see  
The flowers seem to tease you at the garden  
Everybody's there, but you don't seem to care  
What's it with you man, and this garden  
  
Turned into my worst phobia  
A crazy man's utopia  
If you're lost no one can show ya  
But it sure was glad to know ya  
Only poor boys take a chance  
On the garden's song and dance  
Feel her flowers as they wrap around  
But only smart boys do without  
  
You can find it all inside  
No need to wrestle with your pride  
No you ain't losin' your mind  
You're just in the garden  
They can lead you to yourself  
Or you can throw it on the shelf  
But you know you can look inside  
For the garden  
  
I wasn't really scared  
Lost my virginity there  
To a gypsy with blond hair  
But now no one seems to care  
Like a mouse inside a maze  
Wandering 'round four days  
With a smile upon my face  
I never want to leave this place  
Only poor boys take a chance  
On the garden's song and dance  
Feel her flowers as they wrap around  
But only smart boys do without  
Turned into my worst phobia  
A crazy man's utopia  
If you're lost no one can show ya  
But it sure was glad to know ya  
Bye bye  
So long, bye bye  
It's glad to know ya  
Bye bye  
Bye bye  
Aw...so long

And now you're tellin' someone else the same as you told me

Don't a guilty concience bother you

'Twas the biblical cord of life  
Then noticing 'twas connected to his head  
  
How strange, not to believed  
I reached out to feel, and the pony's eyes opened  
The cord got hard, the head looked around  
And you know who pushed and gushed  
The waters of life  
First two hooved feet, then the shine of his fur  
  
But at first to my eyes only  
Feather - feathers - wings  
The butterflies flew up in such colors  
Exploding all around us  
  
The rest I did not see - till there he stood - all eyes in wonder  
  
Who me - who you  
  
Look

Waiting for that day, to come  
  
Green mansions, high upon a hill  
In the countryside where the birds begin to sing  
Free from the glamor of the world  
Where the story does unfurl  
Waiting on that day to come  
  
Tried in vain to forget  
Just how it ought to be  
Over and over and over and over again  
'Bout what it means to me

Birds singing in a melancholy wood  
The big wall all around

Preacher talking 'bout Christ betrayed  
It's like the earth just opened and swallowed him up  
He reached too high, was thrown back to the ground  
You know what they say about bein' nice to the right people on the way up  
Sooner or later you gonna meet them comin' down  
  
Well, there ain't no goin' back when your foot of pride come down  
Ain't no goin' back  
  
Hear ya got a brother named James, don't forget faces or names  
Sunken cheeks and his blood is mixed  
He looked straight into the sun and said revenge is mine  
But he drinks, and drinks can be fixed  
Sing me one more song, about ya love me to the moon and the stranger  
And your fall by the sword love affair with Erroll Flynn  
In these times of compassion when conformity's in fashion  
Say one more stupid thing to me before the final nail is driven in.  
  
Well, there ain't no goin' back when your foot of pride come down

his head

He said he only deals in cash or sells tickets to a plane crash  
He's not somebody that you play around with much

Feed you coconut bread, spice buns in your bed  
If you don't mind sleepin' with your head face down in a grave.  
  
Well, there ain't no goin' back when your foot of pride come down  
Ain't no goin' back  
  
Well they'll choose a man for you to meet tonight  
You'll play the fool and learn how to walk through doors  
How to enter into the gates of paradise  
No, how to carry a burden too heavy to be yours  
Yeah, from the stage they'll be tryin' to get water outta rocks  
A whore will pass the hat, collect a hundred grand and say thanks  
They like to take all this money from sin, build big universities to study in  
Sing ""Amazing Grace"" all the way to the Swiss banks  
  
Well, there ain't no goin' back when your foot of pride come down  
Ain't no goin' back  
  
They got some beautiful people out there, man  
They can be a terror to your mind and show you how to hold your tongue  
They got mystery written all over their forehead  
They kill babies in the crib and say only the good die young  
They don't believe in mercy  
Judgment on them is something that you'll never see  
They can exalt you up or bring you down main route  
Turn you into anything that they want you to be  
  
Well, there ain't no goin' back when your foot of pride come down  
Ain't no goin' back  
  
Yes, I guess I loved him too  
I can still see him in my mind climbin' that hill  
Did he make it to the top, well he probably did and dropped  
Struck down by the strength of the will  
Ain't nothin' left here partner, just the dust of a plague that has left this
whole town afraid  
From now on, this'll be where you're from  
Let the dead bury the dead. Your time will come  
Let hot iron blow as he raised the shade  
  
Well, there ain't no goin' back when your foot of pride come down  
Ain't no goin' back

Behind the distant city  
She will ride under the water  
She will leave her son and daughter  
  
Reduced to lying naked  
To feed those she holds sacred  
She is bare of clothes and beauty  
On disply in her nudity  
  
If someone calls her name out  
All she ever hears are cars  
Through the window in the bathroom  
Through the broken glass and bars  
  
Seeking comfort in the wallet  
Where she placed eighty dollars  
When the last one has departed  
She can slide into the darkness  
  
And slowly down the river  
The current pulls her under  
And it bathes her in it's splendor  
Is unmoved by her surrender  
  
And faint through the water  
The lights like brittle stars  
Someone called her name out  
She no longer hears the cars  
  
Christine...

O Mary you have seduced my soul  
And I don't know right from wrong  
Forever a hostage of your child's world  
  
And then I ran my tin-cup heart along  
The prison of her ribs  
And with a toss of her curls  
That little girl goes wading in  
Rollin her dress up past her knee  
Turning these waters into wine  
Then she platted all the willow vines  
  
Mary in the shallows laughing  
Over where the carp dart  
Spooked by the new shadows that she cast  
Across these sad waters and across my heart

With great expectations I change all my clothes  
Mustn't grumble at silver and gold  
Screaming above central london  
Never bored, so I'll never get old  
  
So I'll wait until we're sane  
Wait until we're blessed and all the same  
Full of blood, loving life and all it's got to give  
Englishman going insane  
Down on my knees in suburbia  
Down on myself in every way

Are you in some hotel room  
Does it have a view?  
Are you caught in a crowd  
Or holding some honey  
Who came on to you?  
Why do you have to be so jive  
O.K. hang up the phone  
It hurts  
But something survives  
Though it's undermined  
I'd still like to see you sometime  
  
I'm feeling so good  
And my friends all tell me  
That I'm looking fine  
I run in the woods  
I spring from the boulders  
Like a mama lion  
I'm not ready to  
Change my name again  
But you know I'm not after  
A piece of your fortune  
And your fame  
'Cause I tasted mine  
I'd just like to see you sometime  
  
Pack your suspenders  
I'll come meet your plane  
No need to surrender  
I just want to see you again  
  
We're in for more rain  
I could sure use some sunshine on my apple trees  
It seems such a shame  
We start out so kind and end so heartlessly  
I couldn't take them all on then  
With a heedful of questions and hypes  
So when the hopes got so slim  
I just resigned  
But I'd still like to see you sometime  
I'd sure like to see you

And now my nights ain't quite so lonely

I fell in love with Lily  
I asked my dad where Lily I could find  
He said, ""Son, now don't be silly""  
  
""She's been dead since 1929""  
Oh, how I cried that night  
If only I'd been born in Lily's time  
It would have been alright

For me and Lily are together in my dreams  
And I ask you, ""Hey mister, have you ever seen""

Upon the back of time

Will he keep a place for me

Swollen seas of tears  
Troubled mind the beating  
War drums in his ears  
No one ever hears his warning  
Am I the one he calls  
When they tell me they're afraid

Never ending tale  
Open up the eyes  
Within your mind, he says  
Crowned in his ancient glory  
There's a king within us all  
Some will say it's all in vain  
That he doesn't have a name

For the evils and abuses

And have yourself another toke

My life flash. before my eyes  
All this sweat grew from one solitary drop  
Grey's movin' cross the floor.  
  
We walk alone, no one beside us!  
It's never simple as black or white.  
We should have known, no one would find us!  
That we would all wind up in  
Shades of grey

And as I turn around, as I turn around, and  
Inside there's no doubt its gonna happen again""

The right words were so hard to find

If they could visualize  
Just open their eyes

If they could open their minds  
They could get beyond  
The world's a funny place you know  
Most of what goes on  
  
Is rarely funny  
Rarely funny  
Could the people understand  
In only whisper and screams  
  
And colorless dreams  
Could they finally comprehend  
If they could suddenly see  
  
And suddenly feel  
The world's a funny place you know  
Most of what goes on  
Is rarely funny

After long years in the monkey-house

Let them throw all their cannonballs  
Let all their strongmen come  
I'm ready to go anywhere  
Through venom, sick and scum!

But this year she's mine and I know why  
Somewhere a flower has to grow  
For every flower that dies  
I'm stricken with fever  
But my heart is strong as steel  
I'm ready to go anywhere!  
I can believe, I can feel!  
  
December is a trusted friend  
I always recognise her face  
It's a plague of fool blown aside  
Forever by her soft and silent grace  
She is reckless as a mayday  
Gentle as a stone  
And ready to go anywhere  
To carry me back home!  
  
December fell deep in the bleak  
Mid-winter time when jesus christ  
Howled a baby saviour's howl  
A primal truth as pure as ice  
And though we crucified him on a cross  
And dragged his name from payer to curse  
He was able to go anywhere  
He was almost one of us!

Razor in my pocket, and as dull as the ice  
Melting slowly in my glass  
My only love is the love of oblivion, in a dark room  
With as couple of pedestrian wolves  
So artfully backlit by a solitary candle  
I take my pleasure in soft red clouds of desire  
So funky in this unwashed bed for one with the soft red dreams of oblivion

I am the crown prince of pavement, I'm so excited

Stretched out so pale and thin  
There is an ocean of bright red liquid love  
And that, my friend, is my favorite color  
Raised by pedestrian wolves out in the forest  
And I take my pleasure on a soft red cloud  
And I take my pleasure in the monkey's bed  
And the wolves still howl and the light still glowing red  
And I take my pleasure in a blue steel cage  
And I take my pleasure through the monkey's eye  
And the wolves all howl while the world around me dies

Do you want him now like you did back then?  
  
I tried my best but your head is such a mess  
So I guess that I don't want you anymore  
Well you say you care about me  
That you just can't do without me  
But you keep on dancin' baby  
'Til that monkey has you on the floor  
  
Why can't you do it?  
Why can't you set your monkey free?  
Always giving into it  
Do you love the monkey or do you love me?  
  
Why can't you do it  
Why do I have to share my baby with a monkey?  
Monkey, with a monkey, monkey  
La la la  
  
Don't look now  
There's a monkey on your back  
Don't look now  
There's a monkey on you  
Don't look now  
There's a monkey on your back  
Don't look now  
There's a monkey on you  
  
So you tell me  
That you won't do anymore  
If I keep on askin' baby, maybe  
I'll get what I'm askin' for  
  
Why can't you do it?  
Why can't you set your monkey free?  
Always giving into it  
Do you love the monkey or do you love me?  
  
Why can't you do it?  
Why do I have to share my baby with a monkey?  
Monkey, with a monkey, monkey  
La la la  
  
Why can't you do it?  
Why can't you set your monkey free?  
Always giving into it  
Do you love the monkey or do you love me?  
  
Why can't you do it?  
Why do I have to share my baby with a monkey?

And baby that's a problem I take real serious  
I can't lie  
It gets to me  
I don't know what to do but to tell you that I love you  
And you know this cause I show it  
Outsiders try to blow it but I can't let it happen No  
  
Everybody's business ain't nobody's business  
In other words  
They don't know half of what I go through  
(To give) give you what you need  
(To be there) to be there for you and still do my thing  
I'm talkin' bout music  
Cause it's what I gotta do to express how I really feel

Without you I can't live

You'll never know  
What they say to you  
Girl let him go (You don't need him)  
You don't need him  
You'd be better off hanging out with me  
They try to break us up  
They don't understand our love cause it gets to deep, girl  
  
Check  
I know a way to make a bunch of people love me  
If you were to leave me all by myself  
Soon as we turn our way back they hustle out  
To tell someone else what's going on  
Misery likes company but we're the only company  
We need to be happy  
And you know this cause I show it  
Outsiders try to blow it but I can't let it happen No

For their mothers' warmth

I don't know where to start

Damn those broken dreams  
Oh yes it could be better  
You can say that about anything  
Some got it worse than me  
Some got it worse than you  
You see the people starvin' underneath the tree  
And you wonder what happened to the golden rule

And cry 'no more, no more'

Waiting for the grey men to go  
When my mind turned on me  
With a vengeance I had never known  
  
My own

The voice on the radio  
Saying 'why move around  
  
And waste my time'  
There are no  
Independents anymore  
The tape is a circle  
But who really cares  
  
I saw you behind the wall  
I even heard you laugh at me  
You disgust me tonight  
With your answer to something new  
That's you

Yes it all happens where I was born  
Miss the fried chicken colored greens  
Miss the hot biscuits and the lima beans  
Miss the prayer meeting where the people pray  
With the drum beating till the break of day

You can have it you can have it  
You can have thy town I won't be around

Back in 1923

Gandma's daddy didn't like me none  
But I loved your grandma so  
  
We had this crazy plan to meet  
And run away together  
Get married in the first town we came too and live forever  
But nailed to the tree where we were supposed to meet, instead  
I found this letter, and this is what it said:  
  
If you get there before I do  
Don't give up on me  
I'll meet you when my chores are through  
I don't know how long I'll be  
But I'm not gonna let you down  
Darling wait and see  
'Cause between now and then, till I see you again  
I'll be loving you, love me  
  
I read these words just hours before  
My grandma passed away  
In the doorway of the church where me and grandpa stop to pray  
I know I've never seen him cry  
In all my 15 years  
But as he read these words to her  
His eyes filled up with tears  
  
If you get there before I do  
Don't give up on me  
I'll meet you when my chores are through  
I don't know how long I'll be  
But I'm not gonna let you down

Western Oklahoma 1943  
I always felt grateful to live in the land of the free  
I gave up my father to South Korea  
The mind of my brother to Vietnam  
Now there's a banker who says I must give up my land  
There are four generations of blood in this topsoil  
Four generations of love on this farm  
Before I give up I would gladly give up my right arm  
What are we making weapons for  
Why keep on feeding the war machine  
We take it right out of the mouths of our babies  
Take it away from the hands of the poor  
Tell me, what are we making weapons for  
I had a son and my son was a soldier  
He was so like my father, he was so much like me  
To be a good comrade was the best that he dreamed he could be  
He gave up his future to revolution  
His life to a battle that just can't be won  
For this is not living, to live at the point of a gun  
I remember the nine hundred days of Leningrad  
The sound of the dying, the cut of the cold  
I remember the moments I prayed I would never grow old  
What are we making weapons for  
Why keep on feeding the war machine  
We take it right out of the mouths of our babies  
Take it away from the hands of the poor  
Tell me, what are we making weapons for  
For the first time in my life I feel like a prisoner  
A slave to the ways of the powers that be  
And I fear for my children, as I fear for the for the future I see  
Tell me how can it be we're still fighting each other  
What does it take for a people to learn  
If our song is not sung as a chorus, we surely will burn  
What are we making weapons for  
Why keep on feeding the war machine  
We take it right out of the mouths of our babies  
Take it away from the hands of the poor  
Tell me, what are we making weapons for  
Have we forgotten all the lives that were given  
All the vows that were taken saying never again  
Now for the first time this could be the last time  
If peace is our vision let us begin  
Have we forgotten all the lives that were given  
All the vows that were taken saying never again, never again  
Now for the first time this could be the last time  
If peace is our vision, let us begin, let us begin

If I see something I like, I'm gonna go for it  
If I see something I want  
You know I'm gonna get down on it  
  
Well I'm hell on wheels I'm a roll on mama  
I can slide down places that you never knew  
Try me on for size at the roll-a-rama  
If you tie my laces and I'll follow you  
Follow you follow you

And a joy I have never felt before

Something I can believe in  
And finally I know what my heart is for  
This is the easiest thing to do  
Yes the easiest thing to do  
It's as simple and as natural  
As breathing out and breathing in  
Yes the easiest thing is lovin' you  
Suddenly I'm weightless  
Feel I could fly or could walk on  
With my feet never touching the ground  
Umm, and I know I'm not crazy  
And now I know I'm not sleeping  
No the searching is over and baby I've found  
That this is the easiest thing to do  
It's the easiest thing to do  
It's as simple and as natural  
As breathing out and breathing in  
Yes the easiest thing is lovin' you  
Suddenly the sadness is gone  
And I don't have to tell myself  
To struggle through  
To carry on

He said he left his soul there overseas  
The notion he defended doesn't matter anymore  
And circumstance had brought him to his knees  
We sat there in the silence of a cold and empty room  
Down the hall I heard a baby cry  
He looked up from the potion he was cooking in a spoon  
And nailed me with the anger in his eye  
Chorus:  
He said, do you really believe in freedom ?  
I said, I do  
He said, oh, what about me ?  
They killed both of her parents in an undercover war  
For wanting all their children to be free  
She said, it's even sadder that it's in el salvador  
They named it for the savior don't you see  
Suddenly the truth was like a blinding flash of light  
Holy thunder rolled across the sky  
I stared into the wonder of the warrior jesus christ  
And destiny was burning in his eyes.  
Chorus:  
He said, do you really believe in freedom ?

Crazy in the night  
  
Dropped in from Munich with a master plan  
Guess he left his wife and kids at home  
He's got so much money rollin'  
From the crimes he'll commit  
But the Siamese cats are gonna take a little bit

Crazy in the night  
Will I turn and run, or do I stand and face the gun?  
Going crazy in the night

Crazy in the night  
Seems there's no way outta here  
Do I turn and run?  
No!  
  
Got no hands, but I've got my head  
I've come so far from the temple  
Maybe this is Babylon, or maybe it's a dream  
If it weren't so beautiful, it would be obscene  
Drinking with the panthers, dancing for their life  
God, this place is hungry  
Come and see the players, but don't stay for the show  
The cats are out tonight, hungry for their rites

And your path is free to walk  
That makes me tend to leave my sleeping bag  
Rolled up and stashed behind your couch  
And it's knowing I'm not shacked  
By forgotten words and boons  
And the ink stains  
That have dried upon some line  
That keeps you in the back roads  
By the rivers of my memory  
Keeps you ever gentle on my mind  
It's not clinging to the rocks and I'd be planted  
On their columns now that binds me  
Or something that somebody said  
Because they thought we fit together walkin'  
It's just knowing that the world will not be cursin' or forgivin'  
When I walk along some railroad track and find  
That you're movin' on the back roads  
By the rivers of my memory  
And for hours you're just gentle on my mind  
Though the wheat fields and the clothes lines  
And the junk yards and the highways come between us  
And some other woman 's cryin' to her mother  
'Cause she turned and I was gone  
I still might run in silence tears of joy, might stain my face  
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind  
But not to where I cannot see you  
Walking on the back roads  
By the rivers flowing gentle on my mind  
I dipped my cup of soap back from a gurglin'  
Cracklin' caltron in some train yard  
My beard a roughen coal pile  
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face  
Through cupped hands round a tin  
Can I pretend to hold you to my breast and find  
That you're waving from the back roads  
By the rivers of my memory  
Ever you're just gentle on my mind

Yesterday, perhaps --  
Danced with Jim and Paul  
And kissed some other chaps.  
  
Once I was young,  
But never was naive.  
I thought I had a trick or two  
Up my imaginary sleeve.  
  
And now I know I was naive.  
I didn't know what time it was  
Then I met you.  
Oh, what a lovely time it was,  
  
How sublime it was too!  
I didn't know what day it was  
You held my hand.  
Warm like the month of May it was,  
  
And I'll say it was grand.  
Grand to be alive, to be young,  
To be mad, to be yours alone!  
Grand to see your face, feel your touch,  
  
Hear your voice say I'm all your own.  
I didn't know what year it was  
Life was no prize.  
I wanted love and here it was  
  
Shining out of your eyes.  
I'm wise,  
And I know what time it is now.

And the memory of love  
And only the sorrow  
  
I yearn for happiness  
I ask for help  
I want mercy  
And my love says:  
  
Look at me and hear me  
Because I am here  
Just for that  
  
I am your moon and your moonlight too  
I am your flower garden and your water too  
I have come all this way, eager for you  
Without shoes or shawl  
  
I want you to laugh  
To kill all your worries  
To love you  
To nourish you

I will soothe you and heal you  
I will bring you roses  
I, too, have been covered with thorns

That the grass is always greener on the other side

And when time is running out you want to stay alive  
  
We all live under the same sky  
We all will live we all will die

There is no right

We all try hard to live our lives in harmony  
For fear of falling swiftly overboard  
But life is both a major and minor key  
Just open up the chord

Come to Jesus today. Let him show you the way  
You're drifting too far from shore...

He's the best friend you ever had  
So, come on, dig, dig, dig in until it hurts  
Just remember Pearl Harbor  
The Alamos and nothing could be worse  
He's your favorite relative  
And he needs a lot to live  
So just bring, bring, bring everything until you bleed  
And he'll send back what he don't need  
If you're not in form, ten-forty's your salvation  
By deprivation of temptation  
Dark and blondes I hear are not deductible  
Oh, say, can you see if there's anything left for me?  
When he calls you as he may do  
Don't be frightened, red white and blue  
Just be thankful you don't live in Leningrad  
He's your uncle, not your dad  
If you're honest, you don't have to shake and shiver  
The food is lousy up the river  
It's give and take and he does all the taking  
Oh, say, can you see if there's anything left for me?  
Life has two things you can't subtract  
Death and taxes to be exact  
So just pa-pa-patriotically declare  
He's your uncle, he's your uncle, not your dad

I kissed your mouth and girl it sure did delight,

The feeling almost drove me crazy out of my mind.

You kissed my neck and then you me right on here,  
And then you threw your thing in my direction,

And woman, it's your heart I hear crying

In reality, he's a link with a past you just can't replace  
You tell the world you're happy when you're lying in his arms  
Oh, but his youth has made you hate to see his face  
And woman, it's your heart I see crying  
Now you're standing like some tree, oh, and the blossom has blown away  
And the last leaf has gone crumbling tumbling towards the ground  
You have nothing to teach me, just have nothing at all to say  
Except to keep on telling me about all the happiness that you do think you
have found

I tried to sweep out all the ruins that my emotions left  
I guess I'm feeling just a little tired of this  
And all the baggage that seems to still exist  
It seems the only blessing I have left to my name  
Is not knowing what we could have been

and...Alchemist..Alchemist..Alchemist...  
Got an axe in the duffel bag, couple of fags,  
Stuffed in the backseat, muzzled n gagged,  
Wrapped in bubble wrap, two lesbians ahh,  
Couple hustler mags, now grab the pez dispenser,  
Fill it up to the max, with muscle relaxers,  
The governor of Alaska, She lusts when I ask her,  
To shove my polaski sausage up in her ass huh,  
While we hover over Nebraska,  
Shooting at the fucking buffalo pasture,  
In the helicopter, man I can't fuck her no faster,  
She's screaming grab my titties, shady suck on those bastards,  
But I ain't no sucker, I won't snuggle up with her after,  
I'm a gigolo, But Ya'll look like the juggalo rapper,  
Everyday man I just seem to get a little bit doper,  
Shit, Back down,  
Man I'd rather lick on a scrotum,  
And eat the fucking octa Mom's pussy lips with some okra,  
While I watch Whoopi Goldberg, Sizzle with Oprah,  
While bossy pussy farts and takes a piss on the sofa,  
Getting home and play dick swords with the Jonas...Brothers,  
Your mother fucking mothers are roamers, Like no other,  
I keep thinking of her smothered in soma's...  
Its chemical warfare, Drop bombs like sadam,  
I'm bringing the drama, Like Barrack Obama,  
Playing rock em' sock em' robots with the Octo Mama,  
I'm vato loco, homie I'll cock those llamas,

I'm obsessive when just one thought of you comes up  
And I'm aggressive just one thought of close enough  
You got me stressing, incessantly pressing the issue  
'Cause every moment gone you know I miss you  
I'm the question and you're of course the answer  
Just hold me close boy 'cause I'm your tiny dancer  
You make me shaken up, never mistaken  
But I can't control myself, got me calling out for help

Yes it's a lesson, it's unfair, you stole my vanity  
My tummy's up in knots so when I see you I get so hot

Take on me (uh huh) you know inside you feel it right

Yesterday's sorrows, tomorrow's white lies.  
Scan the horizon, the clouds take me higher,  
I shall return from out of fire.  
  
Tears for remembrance, and tears for joy,  
Tears for somebody and this lonely boy.  
Out in the madness, the all seeing eye,  
Flickers above us, to light up the sky.  
  
Unchain the colours before my eyes,  
Yesterday's sorrows, tomorrow's white lies.  
Scan the horizon, the clouds take me higher,  
I shall return from out of fire.

Are you listening?  
In the lane  
Snow is glistening  
A beautiful sight  
We're happy tonight  
Walking  
In a winter wonderland  
  
Gone away  
Is the bluebird  
Here to stay  
Is a new bird  
He sings a love song  
As we go along  
Walking  
In a winter wonderland  
  
In the meadow  
We can build a snowman  
And pretend  
That he is Parson Brown  
He'll say are you married?  
We'll say No man  
But you can do the job  
When you're in town  
Later on, we'll conspire  
As we dream, by the fire  
To face unafraid  
The plans that we've made  
Walking  
In a winter wonderland  
  
In the meadow  
We can build a snowman  
And pretend  
That he's a circus clown  
We'll have lots of fun  
With Mr. Snowman  
Until the other kids  
Come knock him down  
  
When it's cold  
Ain't it thrilling  
When your nose  
Gets to chilling  
We'll frolic and play  
The eskimo way  
Walking  
In a winter wonderland  
  
Walking  
In a winter wonderland

Album, and has also been released on the Greatest Hits Vol 3, John Denver
(Italian) and Country Classics Albums.  
  
  
Everybody's got the dancin' fever  
Everbody'd love to rock and roll  
Play it loud and baby play it better  
Funky music gotta stretch your soul  
  
Just relax and let the rhythm take you  
Don't you be afraid to lose control  
If your heart has found some empty spaces  
Dancin's just a thing to make you whole  
  
I am one who dances with the mountains  
I am one who dances with the wind  
I am one who dances on the ocean  
My partner's more than pieces more than friends  
  
Were you there the night they lost the lightning  
Were you there the day the earth stood still  
Did you see the famous and the fighting  
Did you hear the prophet tell his tale  
  
We are one when dancing with the mountains  
We are one when singing in the wind  
We are one when thinking of each other  
More than partners much more than pieces more than friends

Have slipped right out of your hands

Well that's a fact  
But your well ran dry  
So you had to walk another mile

Needs a special part  
But you made your choice  
Now you're stuck with all your big boys toys  
  
Now the word's around  
You've gone aground  
And you've lost your wind  
You'll never see your ship come in

that you say  
It used to please you  
To try to make me  
someone else  
And I thank you from  
My heart for your help  
Cause you made me find  
myself  
  
I used to think if I surrendered  
I'd be the perfect one for you  
But I swear I can't remember  
A single day of happiness with  
you

And there's a price for being

But I can live with who I am

You made me find my love  
You made me find myself

Skies filled with dreams and butterflies  
And I wondered to myself how do I fit in this game?  
Just a nameless face or faceless name  
Then I remembered an old friend of mine how we'd watch tv all night  
Tell each other about our dreams, but I don't see him no more, no.  
Light a cigarette and watch this day go by,  
Burned another six minutes to the sky  
I need a fucking answer but I guess that's why we live this life  
A constant search for something right  
Now my mind is wondering how am I going to get fucked up today,  
Light a bowl and see it all fade away  
It happens everyday

Let's get married  
I love you and I want to stay with you

Have kids and grow old and grey with you

You can get a cat as long as it barks  
  
We know other people  
Who drifted apart  
Who broke each other's hearts  
But we ain't other people  
So we'll do things our way  
We're gonna be okay  
We're gonna be more than okay  
  
Let's get married  
We're ready for tying the knot  
Let's get married  
Set the seal on the feelings we've got  
Let's get married  
We can make each other happy or we can make each other blue  
Yeah, it's just a piece of paper, but it it says, ""I love you.""  
For the good times  
For the days when we can do no wrong  
For the bad times  
For the moments when we think we can't go on  
For the family  
For the lives of the children that we've planned  
Let's get married  
C'mon darlin', please take my hand  
  
And I'll be the one  
Who's by your side  
I'll be the one  
Still taking pride  
When we're old if they ask me,  
""How do you define success?""  
I'll say, ""You meet a woman  
You fall in love  
You ask her and  
She says, 'Yes.'""

Did you ever swoop down from the sky

And the deep blue ocean rolling by?

Maybe I will lose tomorrow  
Gonna rock on to the oceanside  
Did you ever see into the future?  
See the big red sun that won't go down?  
And the giant moths upon the cliffside  
In the deep red scar that was our town?  
Maybe I will find today  
Maybe I will lose tomorrow  
Gonna rock on to the oceanside

Everybody glows and then they're numb  
We can make a moment last forever  
Gaze across the ocean to the sun  
Maybe I will find today  
Maybe I will lose tomorrow

Gonna rock on to the oceanside  
Gonna rock on to the oceanside

He took everything and he got away clean

And as sleep takes me by my hand  
Madrigals from the woods  
Carry me to neverland

The craft of ring making and made the master ring.

I got lost, couldn't find my way  
And I guess there's nothing more to say  
Love can make you blind, make you act so strange  
But I'm here and here I will stay  
  
So everyday I cry  
Yes everyday I fall  
Do you ever wonder why, why I love everything about you  
  
But everyday I say I'll try to make my heart be still  
'til then every way there is to cry, ourselves to sleep we will  
  
It picked me up, knocked me off my feet  
I've got no way to explain  
Still I love you, love you, love you but this fire inside  
Will never see the light of day  
  
So everyday goes by  
And everyday I fall  
It makes me wonder why,  
My life's worth nothing without you  
  
But everyday I say I'll try  
To make my heart be still  
Cause every way there is to cry,  
Ourselves to sleep, we will  
  
You'll never know, no, no, no, no, no  
You'll never know just how close we were  
You'll never know, no, no, no, no, no  
You'll never know  
No you'll never see  
  
The book closes and we try to forget  
But I know that things won't change  
How we feel, how life goes on  
And that seems so strange  
  
And so the light fades away  
Try, try, try as I may  
I can't stop thinking about you  
It seems my life's worth nothing without you  
  
But everyday I say I'll try  
To make my heart be still  
'til then every way there is to cry,  
Ourselves to sleep, we will  
  
Everyday, everyday you know I try so hard  
Everyday, everyday it gets a little harder

Waiting for some cool messiah  
Give me a reason to stay here forever  
Waiting for something to come  
Is it my soul  
Is it that glimpse of light I never forget to expect  
Or is it you, some kind of angel  
That keeps me in waiting forever  
There's too much war on the outside  
Much too much impact of symbols and meanings  
I wonder why I'm still fighting in this ocean of questions  
Is there a reason to stay any longer  
Waiting for something to come  
Give me a reason to stay on this island  
Waiting for something to come

Were searchin' for a diff'rent tune,  
One that they could croon,  
As only they can...  
  
They only had the rhythm... so,  
They started swayin' to and fro...  
They didn't know just what to use,  
That is how the blues,  
Really began...  
  
They heard the breeze in the trees,  
Singin' weird melodies,  
And they made that,  
The start of the blues!  
  
And from a jail came the wail,  
Of a down-hearted frail,  
And they played that,  
As part of the blues!  
  
From a whippoorwill out on the hill,  
They took a new note ( whippoorwill, whippoorwill, whippoorwill... )  
Pushed it through a horn 'till it was worn,  
Into a blue note... ( whippoorwill, whippoorwill, whippoorwill... )  
  
An' then they nursed it, and rehearsed it,  
And gave out the news,  
That the ""Southland""...  
Gave birth to the blues!  
  
( Shout out the wonderful news! )  
Oh, the breeze from the trees,  
A wail from the jail,  
A buzz from the cousin of a nightin'gale,  
And ""Southland"" ( hello, hello! )  
Gave birth to the blues!

Daddy! Oh Daddy, You Promised.  
  
Out on the road in the direction of Perth,  
Backwards and forwards in a circle they went.  
Found a city half open and ready to greet,  
The conquering heros, with blisters on their feet.  
Eleventh Earl of Mar  
Somehow got them all this far.  
Daddy! You Promised, You Promised.  
  
See the Stewart are dressed up  
He's got eyes in the back of his head.  
Who came in a cockleshell boat  
That could only just float,  
Couldn't even lift a sword.  
Dressed too fine and smelling of wine.  
  
Daddy you've got to go!  
Here come the bishop all dressed up  
He's gonna bless you if you're ready to pay  
One wave of his funny old stick,  
There's a band of light across your eyes.  
  
Waited a week still they hadn't appeared,  
That glorious timing that everyone feared.  
So they're riding along on the crest of a wave,  
They're headed for London, And that will be their grave  
Eleventh Earl of Mar  
Well he couldn't get them down that far  
Daddy! I'm waiting, I'm waiting  
  
Time to go to bed now  
Never seems too keen  
To be a guest now  
In a house of dreams  
  
Flying from a hillside  
Beckoning the trees  
A sailboat's awning  
Mimicking the breeze  
  
I'm fighting gravity falling  
My Daddy won't let them get me  
A voice screams seems to be calling  
The face turns features are burning.  
  
Daddy, you've got to go!  
See the fifteen going by,  
Tell the Lairds and the Lords  
They're running backwards today,  
And once again you stand alone.  
  
Bury your memories bury your friends,  
Leave it alone for a year or two.  
Till the stories go hazy and the legends come true,  
Then do it again. Some Things never end.  
Eleventh Earl of Mar  
Won't be going very far.  
You Promised, You Promised, You Promised.  
DADDY!

World shows its face for another scar

Dream on, dream on  
In the arms of night  
Your silent shadow gently speaks  
Dream on, dream on  
This hotel room's a lonely place  
It's a one night cell I must escape  
So I drink away my loneliness  
So I can sleep and dream again  
Although I am far from home now  
My soul's with you  
And as I fall into  
The darkness of the night  
You come to rescue me to  
Shield me in your light  
I feel your touch  
The softness of your skin  
You hold me close before  
The day breaks in  
This dream's so true  
My heart it beats, it beats  
It beats for you, for you  
Although I am far from home now  
My soul's with you

See yourself in all the weird shapes and sizes  
You young man would you like to go into the house of mirrors  
Well okay  
Have a good time son  
And good luck finding your way out  
Wait a minute I don't like it in here  
Hey wait a minute let me out of here  
Let there's dead bodies in here  
There's dead bodies in here  
I don't like it in here!!!""  
  
Step inside, come my way  
This here is your fatal day  
You have lied, they have cried  
Now your life has been denied  
Look into the big mirror  
Your reflection is so clear  
Devil's head, rotting flesh  
With the snakes inside your chest  
In the mirror you can't hide  
You've been granted Jacob's lide  
Whipping fear, spinning pain  
All you crying is in vain  
You're the beast you never knew  
This reflects the things you do  
Others starving down the block  
Richie's heart is like a rock  
How can I make a law?  
I'm just here to break your jaw  
House of Glass, down and up  
You might get your ass cut  
Mirror of Life, Mirror of Pain  
Death, I wave my magic cain  
Your last words are those of fear  
But they go unheard in the House of Mirrors  
  
[Chorus x2]  
Mirror mirror on the wall  
Who's the wickedest of all  
Three blind mice, deepest fear  
Welcome to the House of Mirrors  
  
Magic wand, magic mirror  
Timeless clock says death is near  
Death is here, death is on  
My king bishop takes your pawn  
You can't break House of Mirrors  
That's bad luck for seven years  
Only in my wicked realm  
Of thee untold, now unfold  
Thinking back, what you do  
Buy a richie home or two  
Even though some down and out  
You keep what you could live without  
You're the beast you never knew  
This reflects the things you do  
Others starving down the block  
Richie's heart is like a rock  
First I grab, then I stab  
Cut you up into a slab  
Grind and twist, flick my wrist  
Toss you in the magic mist  
Look into Halls of Glass  
Every mirror shows the past  
With no love you kick the sin of face  
Now your place is in the House of Mirrors  
  
[Chorus x2]  
  
Three blind mice, your worst fear  
Look into the deadly mirror  
  
Welcome to the House of Mirrors, Mr. Exec  
You should explain to E why ICP should let you live  
As you look on I see this image in your reflection  
A bigot under cover, showing no affections  
To the ghettos and the hoods  
Just look at you, you think for us, you're too good  
Claiming all you got and you can die tomorrow  
And when that shit happens, there's no pinion, no sorrow  
'Cause you refuse to lift a hand  
And you know it's a blessing to help a brother man stand  
And if I were you I'd fear myself  
Knowing I was selfish and wouldn't let another near my wealth  
You just gotta let em fall  
You Violent J, ""what up"", bash that head against the wall  
And don't let him run for the door (where you goin, bitch?)  
Make him detour to the sore  
And let's wash away his bigot sins  
While we welcome in some more of his bigot ass friends  
And let them see what they really like  
Hand-high riding the Benz and I'm a clown-riding the bike  
So look closely in the mirror  
You're the beast you never knew, so be the next to volunteer  
To live in the hood with the ICP  
Yo, J, throw away the key to the House of Mirrors

I found my thoughts shift slowly into phase  
Declared the constitution of the walkway  
I realise it's time to plan the day, the day  
  
I'm a market square hero gathering the storms to troop  
Cause I'm a market square hero speeding the beat of the streetpulse  
Are you following me, are you following me?  
Well suffer my pretty warriors and follow me  
  
I got a golden handshake that nearly broke my arm  
I left the ranks of shuffling graveyard people  
I got rust upon my hands from the padlocked factory gates  
Silent chimneys provide the silent steeples  
  
Cause I'm a market square hero gathering the storms to troop  
Cause I'm a market square hero speeding the beat of the streetpulse, the

Are you following me? Are you following me?  
Well suffer my pretty children and follow me, follow me  
  
Change, change, change!  
Change, change, change!

Are you following me  
I am your antichrist pledge to me defiance  
Are you following me  
Suffer my pretty warriors  
Suffer my fallen child  
Are you following me  
The time has come to conquer and I'll provide your end  
Suffer!  
We march!  
  
I give peace signs when I wage war in the disco  
I'm the warrior in the ultra violet haze  
Armed with antisocial insecurity  
I plan the path of destiny from this maze  
  
Cause I'm a market square hero gathering the storms to troop  
Cause I'm a market square hero speeding the beat of the streetpulse, the
streetpulse  
Are you following me? Are you following me?  
Well suffer my fallen angels and follow me  
  
I'm the market square hero  
I'm the market square hero  
We're market square heroes  
We're the market square heroes  
Are you following me?

As we go marching, marching  
In the beauty of the day  
A million darkened kitchens  
A thousand mill lofts grey  
Are touched with all the radiance  
That a sudden sun discloses  
For the people hear us singing  
Bread and roses, bread and roses  
  
As we go marching, marching  
We battle too for men  
For they are women's children  
And we mother them again  
Our lives shall not be sweetened  
From birth until life closes  
Hearts starve as well as bodies  
Give us bread, but give us roses  
  
As we go marching, marching  
We bring the greater days  
For the rising of the women  
Means the rising of the race  
No more the drudge and idler  
Ten that toil where one reposes  
But the sharing of life's glories  
Bread and roses, bread and roses

Well I can be myself here  
I can free myself here  
I can't believe it's last night again  
I see things go down  
I hear the talk of the town  
Like an echo in my ear  
If you should look for me  
I'll be right here  
I can leave myself here  
Or I could use some help here  
I can't believe it's last night again

It's a lonesome sound when this bar shuts down  
So I guess I'll have one more

We agreed to turn our face away, away  
  
Thousands to the million  
Sisters, grandmothers and more  
It's not the feast we throw away  
It's the way we close the door

We try just to ignore  
To waste their future freedom  
We'll regret forever more

Each breaking point is waiting  
For the promise to fulfill

You can always go downtown  
When you got worries, all the noise and the hurry  
Seems to help, I know, downtown  
  
Just listen to the music of the traffic in the city  
Linger on the sidewalks where the neon signs are pretty  
How can you lose?  
The lights are much brighter there  
You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares  
  
And go downtown  
Things'll be great when you're downtown  
No finer place for sure, downtown  
Everything's waiting for you  
  
Don't hang around and let your problems surround you  
There are movie shows, downtown  
Or maybe you know some little places to go to  
Where they never close, downtown  
  
Just listen to the rhythm of the music that they're playin'  
Making conversation while you're on the dance floor swayin'  
Happy again  
The lights are much brighter there  
You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares  
  
And go downtown  
Where all the lights are bright, downtown  
Waiting for you tonight, downtown  
You're gonna be alright now  
  
And you may find somebody kind to help and understand you  
Someone who is just like you and needs a gentle hand to guide them along  
So maybe I'll see you there  
You can forget all your troubles  
Just forget all your cares  
  
And go downtown  
Things'll be great when you're downtown  
Don't wait a minute more, downtown  
Everything's waiting for you  
  
Downtown, where all the lights are bright  
Downtown, waiting for you tonight  
Downtown, you're going to be alright now  
Get on, get on, get on downtown

Put it in a letter to me  
Slippery slimy road down  
  
Life's an ocean too much commotion  
  
Not enough emotion to satisfy me  
Slippery slidy road down  
It's slippery slidy road down  
  
Hold my hand and we'll walk down  
Dry those eyes and we'll walk down  
  
Slippery slidy road down  
Life's an ocean, life's an ocean  
Too much commotion, too much emotion

Hangin' out with my crew  
Hot to trot and about to pop  
Tryin' to find some girl to get into  
  
There she was fine as can be  
Hair braided down to her knees  
She took me home, she turned me out  
But before sunrise she said I must leave  
  
It was a cold chill on a summer night  
Never thought the girlie wouldn't treat me right  
It was a cold chill on a summer day  
Never thought the girl would dog me out that way  
It was a cold chill on a summer morn  
Never cried like a baby since the day I was born  
It was a cold chill on a summer eve  
Never had no chopper bring me to my knees  
  
I was feeling so trusting  
Gave it all right down to the bone  
But she did me wrong  
On a summer night  
  
Far from meek, and feelin' chic  
Refusing to concede defeat  
There I was same crew, same time  
Same club we kicked it at the previous week  
  
I asked her how could she have the nerve  
To treat me with such disgrace  
She blinked her eyes, smiled, apologized  
Threw her drink right in my face  
  
It was a cold chill on a summer night  
Never thought the girlie wouldn't treat me right  
It was a cold chill on a summer day

Never had no chopper bring me to my knees  
  
I was feeling so trusting  
Gave it all right down to the bone  
But she did me wrong  
On a summer night, on a summer night  
On a summer night, on a summer night  
A cold chill, a cold chill, a cold chill, cold chill  
  
Weekends came and weekends passed  
But not the yearning in my heart  
And there she was to light the spark  
Like she did right from the very start  
  
I took no time, drove to her house  
Got deep into a passion high  
I heard a knock, the turn of a key  
And the voice of another guy  
  
It was a cold chill on a summer night  
Never thought the girlie wouldn't treat me right  
It was a cold chill on a summer day  
Never thought the girl would dog me out that way  
It was a cold chill on a summer morn  
Never cried like a baby since the day I was born  
It was a cold chill on a summer eve  
Never had no chopper bring me to my knees  
  
I was feeling so trusting  
Gave it all right down to the bone  
But she did me wrong  
On a summer night, on a summer night  
On a summer night, on a summer night  
  
It was a cold chill  
Like standing in the deep freeze  
A cold chill  
Like when snow's above your knees  
Cold chill  
Like sitting at the north pole  
A cold chill  
Wearing not one stitch of clothes  
Cold chill  
Like a winter Chicago night  
A cold chill  
Twenty ice cubes down your back for spite  
Cold chill  
Stranded in sub-zero degrees  
A cold chill  
Laid out on the arctic sea  
Cold chill  
When your fingers get frost bite  
A cold chill  
Buried beneath ten feet of ice  
Cold chill  
Baby, that ain't so nice  
A cold chill

And walked me into tomorrow

Here in the open, we're walkin' and hopin'  
Together  
  
Sleigh bells ring, are you listenin'?  
In the lane, snow is glistenin'  
A beautiful site, we're happy tonight  
Walkin' in the winter wonderland  
  
Gone away is the blue bird  
Here to stay is a new bird  
He sings his love song, as we go along  
Walkin' in the winter wonderland  
  
In the meadow we can build a snowman  
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown  
He'll say, ""Are you married?"" We'll say, ""No, man""  
But you can do the job when you're in town  
  
Later on, we'll conspire as we dream by the fire  
To face unafraid, the plans that we made  
Walkin' in the winter wonderland

Your punk ass never heard of me  
I never did nothin' to your family  
Still you wanna kill a young nigga randomly  
You wanna take the life God handed to me  
Send it back to him cause you ain't a fan to me  
Scary bitch with a gun that ain't a man to me  
That's an animal,  
A fucking cannibal  
I'm Duranimo and Hannibal  
We international Gangsta bull  
I'm bull and Barcelona, with a Corona  
You a fake ass nigga, where's ya owner?  
I'm real live man, you a persona  
Now I'm a goner, call ma momma, in the corner  
Mister gun man, your plan is working  
Cause niggas is dieing and mommas is hurting

Why you wanna murder me?  
You never ever heard of me  
You don't know who I am  
I could be part of your family tree

To save the word you and me  
You never know who you facin'  
Who ya chasin'

Either T.I.P or B.I.G  
I don't give a fuck what you saw on TV  
But a 187 don't make a O.G.  
  
I'm a O.G  
Never had to fake it  
God gave me this, how you goin' take it  
What you goin' tell 'em, when you get to heaven  
When he asks you why did you send back his present.  
Who the fuck are you, you motherfucking peasant  
Even got the nerve to ask the man for a blessing.  
Send his ass to Hades with his big Mercedes  
Nigga, hell on earth is being stuck in the 80's

[Verse 3]  
Before you shoot me man think about it  
Lets go have a drink about it  
Before you make a stink about it  
Man lets talk about it  
Maybe we can walk about it.  
But just don't be a coward  
And take my life 'cause you got the power  
Of the white mans gun powder  
Cause you might face a gun tower.  
And time never run out,  
They take the fun out, til your life run out.  
So don't pull your gun out,  
If you ever want a house, just like Run's house.  
It's better than a big house,  
Less four-five some woman we can dig out,  
Find a place we can dig out,  
Party all night til the owner say 'get out'  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Dedicated to all the niggas, that's dead and don't know why.  
Who wanna look at the nigga who shot 'em  
And ask these questions.  
  
Why me homie? Why me?

8156,Iggy Pop,A Machine For Loving,/i/iggy+pop/a+machine+for+loving_20798569.html,"Two weeks after my arrival Fox died just after sunset  
I was stretched out on the bed when he approached  
And tried painfully to jump up he wagged his tail nervously  
Since the beginning he hadn't touched his bowl once  
He had lost a lot of weight  
  
I helped him to settle on my lap  
For a few seconds he looked at me  
With a curious mixture of exhaustion and apology  
Then, calmed, he closed his eyes  
Two minutes later he gave out his last breath  
  
I buried him beside the residence  
At the western extremity of the land  
Surrounded by the protective fence  
Next to his predecessors  
  
During the night a rapid transport  
From the Central City dropped off an identical dog  
They knew the codes and how to work the barrier  
I didn't have to get up to greet them  
  
A small white and ginger mongrel  
Came toward me wagging its tail  
I gestured to him  
He jumped on the bed and stretched out beside me  
  
Love is simple to define  
But it seldom happens in the series of beings  
Through these dogs we pay homage to love  
And to its possibility  
  
What is a dog but a machine for loving  
You introduce him to a human being giving him the mission to love  
And however ugly, perverse, deformed or stupid this human being might be  
The dog loves him, the dog loves him

Sure that the gods won't let him fall  
Should he fall, he will always get up again  
And if he's hurt he never shows it  
If he's wrong nobody knows it  
Seems like he never has to try  
He just must be a lucky guy  
And when there's pain he never minds it  
When it's lost he always finds it  
Nobody really knows just why  
He just must be a lucky guy  
He just must be a lucky guy  
I wish I was that lucky guy

Always takin' their advice  
May not be the best for you  
  
So just be my lady  
And that'll be enough for me  
And it won't matter, baby  
What your friends think, they see  
  
Who loves you better  
Better than I do, I do  
Who knows you better  
Better than I do, than I do

My teardrops never see the light of day  
I laugh and joke and paint a bright tomorrow  
But if I told the truth I'd have to say...  
  
Excuse me, I think I've got a heartache  
There's an aching deep inside  
And it just won't be denied  
  
Excuse me, I think I've got a heartache  
And I'd better say goodbye  
Before I cry  
  
I guess it's pride that makes me hide my sorrow  
I live a lie in all I do and say  
My lips may lie and paint a bright tomorrow  
But if I told the truth I'd have to say...

If I ever have a doubt  
What life is all about  
I get my pencil out and then commence to doodlin'  
And I find it real relaxing  
'Specially when I feel that life is really taxing!  
  
'Cause weird designs  
They only show what's going on

Just conceivably might  
Be a thought that you capture  
While coppin' a wink  
Doodlin' takes you beyond what you see  
When you write what you think.  
  
I'd feel so lost without my doodlin',  
Doodlin' really helps me ease my mind,  
I'd be tempest-tossed  
Without my doodlin',  
When I'm doodlin' there's one thing I find,  
  
Truly, I really really really really really truly truly wanna figure out  
What my doodlin's all about.  
  
Later the waiter  
Had me arrested,  
Took me to Bellevue,  
Where I was tested.  
  
Had me a doctor  
Probin' my noodle,  
'Fore he was half-done,  
Taught him to doodle,  
Showed him hidden thoughts that linger  
Find an outlet through your finger,  
Doodlin' away, doodlin' away.  
  
Doctor was real nice,  
Told me to be cool,  
Looked at the waiter,  
Called him the real fool,  
  
Looked at my baby  
Told me he dug her,  
Got me to doodlin',  
So he could bug her,  
  
When he put his arms around her,  
Quite to his surprise he found her,  
Doodlin' away, doodlin' away  
  
We just doodle all day!

6553,Gary Valenciano,Gary Valenciano - Letting Go,/g/gary+valenciano/gary+valenciano+letting+go_20632029.html,"I used to feel the emptiness inside me  
I was not supposed to feel that way  
I had everything I needed  
But nothing ever made me  
What I longed to be  
The wealth, the name  
The lights, the fame  
Were everything to me  
And then one night  
Out of the blue  
I heard His name (Jesus)  
And so I took that step of faith  
And walked into His domain  
I believe that's what He wants  
Every heart to do  
When hard may seem the task  
One step is all He asks of you  
  
Letting go to know the truth  
Is not so hard to do  
It's the heart that's got the will  
To open up for Him to fill  
And trusting and believing Him  
Is all we've got to do  
It's just the heart that's got to move  
For Him to show His love that's been there  
Even when we never cared  
Take hold of His hand  
Let go and you'll understand  
  
Why be afraid  
For God knows what you're feeling  
But even He can't do a thing  
If He sees the heart's not willing  
And so we ask what's going on  
We want what's right and still do wrong  
When hard may seem the task  
One step is all He asks of you  
  
I guess by now you'd realize  
You can't be on your own  
And all your cares  
And all your burdens  
Should be cast upon His throne  
Letting go, just let go, letting go  
Let go and you'll understand  
Just let go and you'll understand

I am the Bullgod  
I am free and I feed  
On all that is forsaken  
  
(I'm gonna get you)  
(I see through you)  
(I'm gonna get youuu)  
  
I'm like a train I roll hard lettin' off much steam  
In the cut-off flanel and the dusty jeans, baby  
I never was cool with James Dean, but I be hangin' tough  
With my man Jim Beam  
  
I swing low like a chimp, back in '86  
Then I was seein' a shrink  
But now I'm humble and I can only think  
About New Orleans and those jumbo shrimp  
  
So ask no questions and I tell no lies  
I got big old pupils and bloodshot eyes  
I'm on the brink, if you know what I mean  
And the twelve step program couldn't keep me clean  
  
'Cause I'm the Bullgod, you understand?  
The illegitimate son of man  
The T-O-P to the D-O-G, or the P-O-T to the G-O-D  
And I'm trippin'  
  
Unh, huh, huh, said I'm trippin'  
  
[Chorus]  
  
A lot of people poke fun and that's alright  
But when I start pokin' back they get all uptight, uh  
You can't cap with the master son  
So sit your ass down 'fore I blast you one  
  
'Cause I'm so greasy you can call me mud  
And I feel a little hate running through my blood  
I want to flood the world with my twisted thoughts  
You can bid all day, but I can't be bought  
  
Uh, break it up, let's tie one on  
I gotta get set to go and cut the lawn  
So I grab my Walkman but before I cut  
I go behind the garage and fire it up  
  
'Cause I'm the Bullgod, you understand?  
The illegitimate son of man  
The T-O-P to the D-O-G, or the P-O-T to the G-O-D  
And I'm trippin'  
  
Huh, huh, said I'm trippin' (Didn't you know?)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Forsaken)  
  
Psh...You ain't nothin'...Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh  
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)  
  
(Come on get 'em up)  
(Come on get 'em up)  
(Come on get 'em up)  
  
[Chorus: x 2]  
  
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)  
(Yeah)  
  
I get a feeling of peace  
From a low so high  
As I sit in my chair and watch life go by  
These thoughts I have, I can't mold the sense  
  
Through the forest of my mind, they're all past tense  
Born and raised in the outer lands  
And at times you could say I'm out of hand  
I'm in a band of gypsies, we're on the run  
  
Every time that paper hits my tongue  
And sometimes it seems so odd  
When my veins are poppin' and I'm on the nod  
I am the Bullgod, you understand?  
And here in my hand is my master plan  
  
I'm gonna get you  
I see through you  
I'm gonna get you  
I see through you!

A lonely house, 'cos now you're gone  
Seven rooms, that's all it is, seven rooms of gloom  
I live with emptiness, without your tenderness  
  
You took the dream I had for us, and turned that dream into dust  
I watch a phone that never rings, I watch a door that never rings  
I need you back into my life and turn this darkness into light  
I'm all alone in this house, turn this house into a home  
  
I need your touch to comfort me, your tender tender arms that once held me  
Without your love, your love inside  
This house is just a place to run and hide  
Seven rooms, that's all it is, seven rooms of gloom  
I live with emptiness, without your tenderness  
  
Don't make me live from day to day, watching a clock that ticks away  
Another day, another way, another reason for me to say  
I need you here, here with me, I need you, darlin', desperately  
I'm all alone, all alone in this house that's not a home  
  
I miss your love I once have known, I miss your kiss that was my very very own  
Empty silence surrounds me, lonely walls, they stare  
Seven rooms, that's all it is, seven rooms of gloom  
I live with emptiness, without your tenderness  
  
And all the windows are painted black, I'll wait right here 'til you get back  
I keep waitin' and waitin', 'til your face again I see

And my tears would start falling once more

For each moment the candle is burning

Wrapped in horsepower, driving into fury

And everything goes rushing by, with every nerve alive  
We move so fast it seems as though we've taken to the sky  
Love machines in harmony, we hear the engines cry.  
I'm your turbo lover  
Tell me there's no other

Better run for cover

In perfect synchronicity of which so many speak  
We feel so close to heaven in this roaring heavy load  
And then in sheer abandonment, we shatter and explode.

There's a hard moon risin' on the streets tonight  
There's a reckless feeling in your heart as you head out tonight  
Through the concrete canyons to the midtown light  
Where the latest neon promises are burning bright  
  
Past the open windows on the darker streets  
Where unseen angry voices flash and children cry  
Past the phony posers with their worn out lines  
The tired new money dressed to the nines  
The low life dealers with their bad designs  
And the dilettantes with their open minds  
  
You're out on the town, safe in the crowd  
Ready to go for the ride  
Searching the eyes, looking for clues  
There's no way you can hide  
The fire inside  
  
Well you've been to the clubs and the discotheques  
Where they deal one another from the bottom of a deck of promises  
Where the cautious loners and emotional wrecks  
Do an acting stretch as a way to hide the obvious  
And the lights go down and they dance real close  
And for one brief instant they pretend they're safe and warm  
  
Then the beat gets louder and the mood is gone  
The darkness scatters as the lights flash on  
They hold one another just a little too long  
And they move apart and then move on  
  
On to the street, on to the next  
Safe in the knowledge that they tried  
Faking the smile, hiding the pain  
Never satisfied  
The fire inside  
Fire inside  
  
Now the hour is late and he thinks you're asleep  
You listen to him dress and you listen to him leave  
Like you knew he would  
You hear his car pull away in the street  
Then you move to the door and you lock it when  
He's gone for good  
  
Then you walk to the window and stare at the moon  
Riding high and lonesome through a starlit sky  
And it comes to you how it all slips away  
Youth and beauty are gone one day  
No matter what you dream or feel or say  
It ends in dust and disarray  
  
Like wind on the plains, sand through the glass  
Waves rolling in with the tide  
Dreams die hard and we watch them erode  
But we cannot be denied  
The fire inside

She'll take your hand, cause they call her the sweet omega  
Then she'll take away the sadness in your heart  
Cause the only road that you'll ever need to ride  
Is the one that's rolling out, beyond her eyes  
And although she'll bring you joy  
Don't you know she can destroy  
Oh lord she's changing me  
The only road you'll ever need to ride  
The only road you'll ever need to ride  
The only road you'll ever need to ride  
Oh, lord she's changing me...

Disillusion's real  
I believe that morality's gone  
And there's nothing to feel  
  
If you take the sacred things  
The things that we hold dear  
Empty promise is all you'll find  
So give me something  
  
Something to believe in  
I believe in a changing of the guard  
Put our feet on the ground  
See it happen in your own backyard  
  
Everything breaks down  
Do you accept what you are told  
Without even thinking  
Throw it all and make your own  
  
And give me something  
Something to believe in  
Where they lead  
You will follow  
  
Well I guess that's just the way it goes  
And if you look away  
You'll be doing what they say  
An if you look alive  
  
You'll be singled out and tried  
If you take home anything  
Let it be your will to think  
The more cynical you become  
  
The better off you'll be

The smell of chestnuts in the air  
And Christmas lights they gleam  
Across the sky

When I held you close to me  
Do you remember?

Come and joy  
The tidings to the world

Always the best time

They won't let him walk up my path  
  
But my mama says don't worry when they say those things about you  
You remember, you're just as good as him  
Just because they got that big house sittin' way upon the hill  
Why, you don't have to look up to them  
  
We've got chicken every Sunday and the preacher comes around  
And every Saturday morning daddy takes us all to town  
And we'd go to the picture show, have picnics on the ground  
Oh, that's the lower class then I'm glad that's what I am  
  
Cause my mama don't belong to the ladies social set  
My daddy can't afford the country club  
His folks look down on me and they don't let us date  
Cause they think that I'm not good enough  
  
But my mama says forgive him honey, he ain't worth at all  
And if anything, you're too good for him  
Just because they've got money and a big fine house  
Aha, we won't take no sad talks off them

Take the roads that I have walked along  
Looking for tomorrows time  
Piece of mind  
  
As my life spills into yours  
Changing with the hours  
Filling up the world with time  
Turning time to flowers  
I can show you all the songs  
That I never sang to one man before  
  
We have seen a million stones  
Lying by the water  
You have climbed the hills with me  
To the mountain shelter  
Taking off the days  
One by one  
Setting them to breathe  
In the sun  
  
Take the lilies and the lace  
From the days of childhood  
All the willow winding paths  
Leading up and outward  
This is what I give  
This is what I ask you for  
  
This is what I give  
This is what I ask you for  
Nothing more

Where the meadow saffrons blow  
The feet of summer dabble  
In their coiling calm and slow  
The banks are worn forever  
By a people sadly gay  
A Titan with loud laughter  
Made them of fire clay  
Go ask the springing flowers  
And the flowing air above  
What are the twin-born waters  
And they'll answer Death and Love  
  
With wreaths of withered flowers  
Two lonely spirits wait  
With wreaths of withered flowers  
'Fore paradise's gate.  
They may not pass the portal  
Poor earth-enkindled pair  
Though sad is many a spirit  
To pass and leave them there  
Still staring at their flowers

Go ask the youngest angel  
She will say with bated breath

Nothin' out my window but desert, dirt, and death

Sometimes that hot horizon plays tricks on you I swear  
  
Oh, I picked her up  
  
Sure enough that girl was real, sittin' in my truck  
Said I know a place called the broken wheel where we can try our luck  
Five miles north of 66, behind old man lester's barn  
Where the whisky flows and the money goes and the sheriff claims that he don't
know  
  
Oh, here I go again, singin'  
  
Bang bang  
That cell door's closin' in  
Bang bang  
Here I go again  
Bang bang  
Those chains around my legs  
Bang bang  
This is where the highway ends  
  
4 am I was outta cash when she whispered in my ear  
I got a gun and a plan, pull the truck up to the rear  
Yeah it hit me like a tire tool right between the eyes  
When the door flew open, she came out screamin'  
Drive fool drive!  
  
Oh, here I go again singin'  
  
Bang bang

You held it in your hands  
I had flashes  
But you saw the plan  
I wandered out in the world for years  
While you just stayed in your room  
I saw the crescent  
You saw the whole of the moon  
The whole of the moon  
  
You were there in the turnstiles  
With the wind at your heels  
You stretched for the stars  
And you know how it feels  
To reach too high  
Too far  
Too soon  
You saw the whole of the moon  
  
I was grounded  
While you filled the skies  
I was dumbfounded by truth  
You cut through lies  
  
I saw the rain dirty valley  
You saw Brigadoon  
I saw the crescent  
You saw the whole of the moon!  
  
I spoke about wings  
You just flew  
I wondered I guessed and I tried  
You just knew  
I sighed  
... but you swooned!  
I saw the crescent  
You saw the whole of the moon  
The whole of the moon!  
  
With a torch in your pocket  
And the wind at your heels  
You climbed on the ladder  
And you know how it feels  
To get too high  
Too far  
Too soon  
You saw the whole of the moon  
The whole of the moon!  
  
Unicorns and cannonballs  
Palaces and piers  
Trumpets towers and tenements  
Wide oceans full of tears  
Flags rags ferryboats  
Scimitars and scarves  
Every precious dream and vision  
Underneath the stars  
  
Yes you climbed on the ladder  
With the wind in your sails  
You came like a comet  
Blazing your trail  
Too high  
Too far  
Too soon  
You saw the whole of the moon

Five miles out of the city limit we're singin'  
And your hand's upon my knees  
So we're ok, we're fine

Adding up the total of a love that's true  
Multiply life by the power of two  
I know the things that I am afraid of  
I'm not afraid to tell  
And if we ever leave a legacy  
It's that we loved each other well  
'Cause I've seen the shadows of so many people  
Trying on the treasures of youth  
But a road fancy and fast ends in a fatal crash  
And I'm glad we got off to tell you the truth

Multiply life by the power of two  
All the shiny little trinkets of temptation  
Something new instead of something old  
But all you gotta do is scratch beneath the surface  
And it's fool's gold  
Fool's gold  
Now we're talking about a difficult thing  
And your eyes are getting wet  
I took us for better and I took us for worse  
And don't you ever forget it  
Now there's steel bars between me and a promise  
Suddenly bend with ease  
And the closer I'm bound in love to you  
The closer I am to free

Chase all the ghosts from your head

There are always two sides to every story'  
  
Find yourself in the gutter in a lonely part of town  
Where death waits in the darkness with a weapon to cut some stranger down  
Sleeping with an empty bottle, he's a sad and an empty hearted man  
All he needs is a job, and a little respect, so he can get out while he can  
  
We always need to hear both sides of the story  
  
A neighborhood peace is shattered it's the middle of the night  
Young faces hide in the shadows,  
While they watch their mother and father fight  
He says she's been unfaithful, she says her love for him has gone  
And the brother shrugs to his sister and says  
Looks like it's just us from now on'  
  
We always need to hear both sides of the story  
  
And the lights are all on, the world is watching now  
People looking for truth, we must not fail them now  
Be sure, before we close our eyes  
Don't walk away from here  
'Til you hear both sides  
  
Here we are all gathered in what seems to be the centre of the storm  
Neighbours once friendly now stand each side of the line that has been drawn  
They've been fighting here for years, but now there's killing on the streets  
While small coffins are lined up sadly, now united in defeat  
  
We always need to hear both sides of the story  
  
And the lights are all on, the world is watching now  
People looking for truth, we must not fail them now  
Be sure, before we close our eyes  
Don't walk away from here  
'Til you see both sides  
  
White man turns the corner, finds himself within a different world  
Ghetto kid grabs his shoulder, throws him up against the wall  
He says 'would you respect me if I didn't have this gun  
'Cause without it, I don't get it, and that's why I carry one'  
  
We always need to hear both sides of the story

Appears through the driving rain,

All I know is that sometimes the truth is contrary of everything in life you
thought you knew

Drowned by the cheer from the shore,

through the darkening storm,  
Gather everything they can score,  
Turn their backs when there's no more

In the teeth of an icy grave

Washed away in the pounding waves,  
Washed away in the pounding waves

All I know is that sometimes the truth is contrary of all the things in life
you thought you knew,  
All I know is that sometimes you have to be wary, because sometimes the target

striking out like a bull from a balloon,

Be set free  
  
You never said no  
You never said yes  
But now there's something you  
Need to confess to me willingly  
Are we history?  
I never rewind  
I never press play  
But I know that  
I've seen it all too many  
Times for me  
It's our history  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Everyone is holding me back  
From my place, am I displaced?  
Because I couldn't see that  
Everyone is wasting my time  
And I will not wait for you  
Because that day will come when  
  
Everyone and everything is  
Pulling me out of my brain  
Everyone and everything is  
Pulling me out of my brain  
Maybe I should try and stay with you.  
Everyone and everything is (No matter what you say)  
Pulling me out of my brain (No matter what you say)  
Maybe I should try and stay with you (No matter what you say)

They were lying on the ground.

A telephone ringing in the hallways  
When times are mysterious

Can put your mind at ease

Here and overseas

I will love you innumerably

And the numbers all come home  
The four rolls into three  
The three turns into two  
And the two becomes a  
One

I'm gonna leave my records  
And a forwarding address  
Ain't you glad honey  
That I'm offa your chest  
  
You said you wanted Paris  
Rome 'n' St. Tropez  
Perfume by Chanel  
And a ring by Cartier  
But I gave you headaches  
With my old fashioned ways  
But that's all irrelevant  
To what I'm tryin' to say  
I'm a fool for you baby  
Pride won't let me stay  
I'm a fool for you honey  
and I'll come back any day  
Guess I'll always love you all my life  
  
You can keep your Streisands  
Bardots and Lorens  
You're my everything  
But now you're my end  
It may be over  
But just before I go  
I can make a new start  
But I can't mend a broken heart  
  
So when I read about you  
In all the national press  
On the arm of so and so  
I may get depressed  
Cause I tried to love you  
But didn't fit in  
I came on the dust  
I'll leave on the wind  
  
I'm a fool for you baby  
My pride won't let me stay  
I'm a fool for you honey  
I'll come back any day  
I'm a fool for you baby  
I don't care what your friends say  
I'm a fool for you honey  
And that's the way I'll stay  
I guess I'll always love you all my life

I've no need for anymore

Back when I was feeling broken,  
I focused on a prayer  
You came deep as the ocean  
It's something something out there here  
All the complexities and games  
No one wins, but somehow, they still play  
All the missing crooked hearts  
They may die, but in us they live on  
  
I believe,  
And I believe 'cause I can see,  
Our future days,  
Days of you and me  
  
When hurricanes and cyclones rage,  
When wind turned dirt to dust,  
When floods they came or tides they raised ever,  
Closer became us  
  
All the promises at sundown,  
I meant them like the rest,  
All the demons used to come around,  
I'm grateful now they've left  
  
So persistent in my ways,  
Here a angel, lying here to stay  
No resistance, no alarms, please this is just too good to be gone

And I believe 'cause I can see,

Your eyes pierce through my heart  
Your smile tears me apart  
I knew it, it's so true  
I'll never get over you  
  
You touch me making my heart race  
So much was written on your face  
I knew when you arrived  
That no words could describe  
What your love made me do  
I'll never get over you  
  
Girl, you're so much heart and soul  
Girl, was a moonlit night you came into my life  
And now this feeling has grown  
And if you leave me alone I know  
I'll never get over you  
  
So hide the moments when I feel blue  
You warm the coldest feet  
Can cool me in the heart  
And all though love was new  
I'll never get over you  
My understanding grew  
But I'll never get over, never get over you

Real real ugly, your grandmama love me  
And your mama love me, little sister hugs me  
Even got a few homegirls that wanna fuck me  
Soon as this shit end, forget about it  
You been stayin' in my crib, you gotta get up out it  
Cause if you layin' in my bed, let's admit about it  
One time fuckin' and we no longer upset about it  
Cause when this shit ends it's either all or nothin'  
I thought you loved me, how the hell you gon call ya cousin?  
You know the diesel ass, half slow, evil ass  
Nigga in that Honda showin' up with that drama  
On my mama, we been through it all  
From the goods to the bads, rise to the fall  
You done seen me at my best, seen me at my worst

Good chick a lil mad as fuck, she done had enough  
I be, out here tryna raise my status up  
But success bring bitches, and they bad as fuck  
Ass fat as fuck, with a little ol' waist  
I ain't want the whole meal, just a little ol' taste  
Should have looked both ways fore I crossed you  
I guess I never thought I could have ever have lost you  
Now I'm out stuntin' with this bitch, you ain't about nothin'  
While some nigga learnin' all the shit I taught you  
Damn, guess you deserve that, a new start  
But deep down you know we grew apart  
Long before I broke your heart, if I lost your respect  
I'm just hopin' you don't look at me as you somethin' you regret

[Verse 3: J. Cole]  
I got your message I been meanin' to respond, know it's been awhile  
Apologies, I ain't been around  
I wanna kick it, but I know that shit is different now  
And times have changed  
Let me know if I'm out of bounds, are the lines the same?  
I mean ya, lookin' good, yeah you still got it  
Been reminiscin' and I'm not sure how I feel about it  
Now we can say that all good things come to an end  
But we know each other way too well to pretend  
We went from friends to somethin' much more  
To breakin' up to makin' up and fuckin' once more  
Second chances, we gave enough to finally  
We gave it up, but some days I be wakin' up and wantin' one more  
But what for? Maybe it's just the weather  
We break each others heart's, so maybe it's for the better  
Holler whenever, cause you always got a friend in me  
And nothin' lasts forever, least we got these memories

Whatever you want, you're gonna get it!  
  
Tommy gun  
You can be a hero in an age of none  
Tommy gun  
I'm cutting out your picture from page one  
I'm gonna get a jacket just like yours  
An' give my false support to your cause  
Whatever you want, you're gonna get it!  
  
Boats an' tanks and planes, it's your game  
Kings an' queens an' generals learn your name  
I see all the innocents, the human sacrifice  
And if death comes so cheap  
Then the same goes for life!

1515,Black Sabbath,Under The Sun,/b/black+sabbath/under+the+sun_20272607.html,"Well, I don't want no Jesus freak to  
Tell me what it's all about  
No black magician telling me  
To cast my soul out  
Don't believe in violence  
I don't even believe in peace  
I've opened the door  
Now my mind has been released  
  
Well I don't want no preacher  
Telling me about the god in the sky  
No I don't want no one to tell me  
Where I'm gonna go when I die  
I wanna live my life, I don't want  
People telling me what to do  
I just believe in myself  
'Cause no one else seems true  
  
Every day just comes and goes  
Life is one long overdose  
People try to rule the nation  
I can see through their frustration  
  
People riding their real peace  
keep on running their rat race  
Behind each flower there grows a weed  
In their world of make-believe  
  
So believe what I tell you  
It's the only way to fight in the end  
Just believe in yourself you know you really  
shouldn't have to pretend  
Don't let those empty people  
Try and interfere with your mind  
Just live your life  
And leave them all behind

Running away will just change the view

Step into these shoes no reason to fight

About the people I meet  
The carwash on the corner  
And the hole in the street  
The way my ankles hurt  
With shoes on my feet  
And I'm wondering  
If I'm gonna see tomorrow.  
  
Father forgive us  
For what we must do  
You forgive us  
We'll forgive you  
We'll forgive each other  
Till we both turn blue  
Then we'll whistle and go fishing  
In heaven.  
  
I was in the army  
But I never dug a trench  
I used to bust my knuckles  
On a monkey wrench  
Then I'd go to town and drink  
And give the girls a pinch  
But I don't think  
They ever even noticed me.  
  
Fish and whistle  
Whistle and fish  
Eat everything  
That they put on your dish  
And when we get through  
We'll make a big wish  
That we never have  
To do this again  
Again? again????  
  
On my very first job  
I said thank you and please  
They made me scrub a parking lot  
Down on my knees  
Then I got fired  
For being scared of bees  
And they only give me  
Fifty cents an hour.

Where a hero's welcome, would be waiting for me  
Where the crowds will cheer, when they see my face  
And a voice keeps saying, this is where I'm meant to be  
  
I'll be there someday, I can go the distance  
I will find my way, if I can be strong  
I know ev'ry mile, will be worth my while  
When I go the distance, I'll be right where I belong  
  
Down an unknown road, to embrace my fate  
Though that road may wander, it will lead me to you  
And a thousand years, would be worth the wait  
It might take a lifetime, but somehow I'll see it through  
  
And I won't look back, I can go the distance  
And I'll stay on track, no, I won't accept defeat  
It's an uphill slope, but I won't lose hope  
Till I go the distance, and my journey is complete  
  
But to look beyond the glory is the hardest part  
For a hero's strength is measured by his heart  
  
Like a shooting star, I will go the distance  
I will search the world, I will face it's harms  
I don't care how far, I can go the distance  
Till I find my hero's welcome, waiting in your arms  
  
I will search the world, I will face it's harms

Unlock the timers  
And strike the chimers  
In my sleep  
  
Grab the coat - steal the fleece  
From behind the curtain  
It will most certainly  
Bring peace  
  
To those with countless numbers  
No cold or hot  
Like things that I will keep  
And hide them in my sleep  
  
Coded ancient  
Oh brightness we shall see  
Loaded up and at night when  
We shall flee  
Not to tread through the  
Heavy life  
Sink in the dream  
On the right night  
You'll find her waiting  
  
Selling things for cheap  
The things that I will keep

I live for your desires  
forget my own, your needs will come before

to make me stop loving you  
and every breath I take

you sleep inside my dreams and know for sure  
who could ever love you more?

To lead us from our sin  
Remove our failures

Find a way in itself

And all my senses are coming unglued  
Is there any cure for this disease  
Someone called love  
Not as long as there are  
Girls like you  
  
Everything she does questions my mental health  
It makes me loose control  
I just can't trust myself  
  
If someone can hear me slap some sense in me  
But you turn your head and I end up talking to myself  
Anxiety has got me strung out and frustrated  
So I loose my head or bang it up against the wall  
  
Sometimes I wonder if I should be left alone  
And lock myself up in a padded room  
I'd sit and spew my guts out to the open air  
No one wants to hear a drunken fool  
  
I do not mind if this goes on  
Cause now it seems I'm too far gone  
I must admit I enjoy myself  
Eighty please keep taking me away

My name is Emmett Till  
I walked this earth for fourteen years  
Then one night I was killed  
For speaking to a woman  
Whose skin was as white as dough  
That's a sin in Mississippi  
But how was I to know  
  
I'd come down from Chicago  
To visit with my kin  
Up there I was a cheeky kid  
I guess I always been  
But the harm they put upon me  
Was too hard for what I done  
For I was just a black boy  
I never hurt no one  
  
They took me from my uncle's house  
Mose Wright was his name  
He'd later stand and without hesitation  
Point the blame  
At the ones who beat and cut me  
And shot me with a gun  
Then threw me in the river  
Like I was trash when they were done  
  
I was sent back to my mother  
At least what was left of me  
She kept my casket open  
For the whole wide world to see  
The awful desecration  
And the evidence of hate  
You could not recognize me  
The mutilation was so great  
  
There came a cry for justice then  
To be finally fulfilled  
All because of me, a black boy  
My name is Emmett Till  
  
But I'd have rather lived  
'Til I was too old to die young  
Not miss all I left behind  
All that might have come  
The summer clouds above my head  
The grass beneath my feet  
The warmth of a good woman  
Her kisses soft and sweet  
  
Perhaps to be a father  
With a black boy of my own  
And watch him grow into  
A kinder world than I had known  
  
Where no child would be murdered  
For the color of his skin  
And love would be the only thing  
Inside the hearts of men  
  
They say the horror of that night  
Is still haunting heaven still  
Where I am one more black boy  
My name is Emmett Till

37183,Iron Maiden,Rime Of The Ancient Mariner,/i/iron+maiden/rime+of+the+ancient+mariner_20068045.html,"Hear the rime of the ancient mariner  
See his eye as he stops one of three  
Mesmerizes one of the wedding guests  
Stay here and listen to the nightmares of the sea.  
  
And the music plays on, as the bride passes by  
Caught by his spell and the mariner tells his tale.  
  
Driven south to the land of the snow and ice  
To a place where nobody's been  
Through the snow fog flies on the albatross  
Hailed in God's name, hoping good luck it brings.  
  
And the ship sails on, back to the North  
Through the fog and ice and the albatross follows on.  
  
The mariner kills the bird of good omen  
His shipmates cry against what he's done  
But when the fog clears, they justify him  
And make themselves a part of the crime.  
  
Sailing on and on and north across the sea  
Sailing on and on and north 'til all is calm.  
  
The albatross begins with it's vengeance  
A terrible curse a thirst has begun  
His shipmates blame bad luck on the mariner  
About his neck, the dead bird is hung.  
  
And the curse goes on and on at sea  
And the curse goes on and on for them and me.  
  
""Day after day, day after day,  
We stuck nor breath nor motion  
As idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean  
Water, water everywhere and  
All the boards did shrink  
Water, water everywhere nor any drop to drink.""  
  
There calls the mariner  
There comes a ship over the line  
But how can she sail with no wind in her sails and no tide?  
  
She... onward she comes  
Onward she nears out of the sun  
See, she has no crew  
She has no life, wait but here's two.  
  
Death and she life in death,  
They throw their dice for the crew  
She wins the mariner and he belongs to her now.  
Then, crew one by one  
They drop down dead, two hundred men  
She, she, Life in Death.  
She lets him live, her chosen one.  
  
""One after one by the star dogged moon,  
Too quick for groan or sigh  
Each turned his face with a ghastly pang  
And cursed me with his eye  
Four times fifty living men  
(And I heard nor sigh nor groan)  
With heavy thump, a lifeless lump,  
They dropped down one by one.""  
  
The curse it lives on in their eyes  
The mariner he wished he'd die  
Along with the sea creatures  
But they lived on, so did he.  
  
And by the light of the moon  
He prays for their beauty not doom  
With heart he blesses them  
God's creatures all of them too.  
  
Then the spell starts to break  
The albatross falls from his neck  
Sinks down like lead into the sea  
Then down in falls comes the rain.  
  
Hear the groans of the long dead seamen  
See them stir and they start to rise  
Bodies lifted by good spirits  
None of them speak and they're lifeless in their eyes  
  
And revenge is still sought, penance starts again  
Cast into a trance and the nightmare carries on.  
  
Now the curse is finally lifted  
And the mariner sights his home  
Spirits go from the long dead bodies  
Form their own light and the mariner's left alone.  
  
And then a boat came sailing towards him  
It was a joy he could not believe  
The pilot's boat, his son and the hermit,  
Penance of life will fall onto him.  
  
And the ship it sinks like lead into the sea  
And the hermit shrives the mariner of his sins.  
  
The mariner's bound to tell of his story  
To tell this tale wherever he goes  
To teach God's word by his own example  
That we must love all things that God made.  
  
And the wedding guest's a sad and wiser man  
And the tale goes on and on and on.

So many riffs you have with your girl  
But I'm here to hear all your problems and tell you I understand,  
Falling in and out of love with her now. As I watch all I can see... Is you
being with me,  
I know you feel like a fool, being used, paying dues,  
Afraid of your loving is taken advantage of,  
You don't have to live a life full of strife, take my hand and i'll be the
leader  
You can depend on me  
  
Chorus  
You can be living in my world, sharing my time, being the one,  
Stare in the face of love, long enough to see,  
You can be living in my world, you'll never shed another tear,  
And i'll never stop the love, I'll give you all of me  
  
With open eyes and ears I can hear, hear your crys come from the inside,  
But baby its alright, you can just let it go, I'm your friend  
Sitting here, willing to listen... Oh baby see that you don't have to live,  
Like you do, come with me be my king i'll be by your side,  
Just let me know what to do, only one goal in mind,  
Take your heart, share with mine, make you believe, so you can see that  
  
Chorus  
  
It only takes one look to see,  
That she's a fool and you should know,  
Come with me, and I will be... All that you need,  
Theres no dreams we can't make real,  
And theres no feelings we can't feel,  
I'm just... Wanting you... Needing you.. Don't you know

Covering someone tiny

In and out the traffic  
Dodging here and there  
That umbrella went with a Don't-Care air  
I said in wonder  
Who is that down under  
Hugging that umbrella like a teddy bear  
  
Horns started blaring  
Everyone was staring  
At that strange object in the street  
Big black and shiny  
Covering someone tiny  
And all that we could see were two small feet  
  
Then a young policeman  
Called out from his beat  
""That umbrella there has a boy down deep""  
He swooped down under  
Pulled out Billy Blunder  
Just a tiny truant from his morning's sleep

Who was once down under  
Recites by heart his safety code  
""When you are out  
In rain or hail or thunder  
Hold up your umbrella when you cross the road! ""

Now  
I get up seven times  
Just to cover his feet  
  
Now  
There is pain  
But i' ve packed it away for next year  
  
Now  
There is newness and grace and for now,  
There' s no fear.  
  
Later  
When all of this has turned to songs  
And faded pics  
  
Later  
When colored wooden blocks  
Turn into heavy bricks  
  
Later  
When you will greet me only  
With the shyest smile  
  
Who knows what later brings?  
And so meanwhile..  
  
Now  
There is light coming in  
Through the crack in the door  
  
Now  
There is hope  
Where i' d never expect it before  
  
Now  
There are so many things  
But there' s nothing at all  
  
Now  
You are learning to stand  
I am learning to fall.

A little time of devotion  
I second that emotion  
  
Maybe you'll think that love will tie you down  
And you don't have the time to hang around  
Or maybe you'll think that love will make us fools  
And so it makes you wise to break the rules  
Oh, little girl!

Look at me, I am old, but I'm happy  
  
I was once like you are now, and I know that it's not easy  
To be calm when you've found something going on  
But take your time, think a lot  
Why, think of, everything you've got  
For you will still be here tomorrow, but your dreams may not  
  
How can I try to explain, when I do, he turns away again  
It's always been the same, the same old story  
From the moment I could talk I was ordered to listen  
Now there's a way and I know that I have to go away  
I know I have to go  
  
It's not time to make a change, just sit down, and take it slowly  
You're still young, that's your fault  
There's so much you have to go through  
Find a girl, settle down, if you want you can marry  
Look at me, I am old, but I'm happy  
  
All the times that I cried, keepin' all the things I knew inside  
It's hard, but it's harder to ignore it  
If they were right, I'd agree, but it's them you know not me

You climbed to the top of the hill then tumbled  
Too many promises come cheap.

For without a ride  
He knew Christmas Day was done

Came a light bright as a star  
Cutting through the night  
Was the two headlights

We're used to chasing rainbows, but they're not hard to find  
My baby used to love me, fame left it all behind  
Now I've become a prisoner, locked up behind four walls  
You say I've got life easy, but I've got no life at all  
So now I've made the grade, they know who I am  
I've made it to the top a lonely man  
  
Those hot lights and Hollywood dreams  
Can't bring back the love that you gave to me  
Headlines and star on the rise  
I lost you chasing those Hollywood Dreams  
  
Smile for the cameras is all they ever say  
Transmitting my emotions a thousand miles away  
They chase me through the streets, calling out my name  
I'm coming home to you, this life is driving me insane  
Climbing up those stairs, knocking on the door  
She don't recognize me or want me anymore

All through the night.  
Oh, baby, all through the night,

Everybody's gonna look for a bell to ring,  
All through the night.

Best friend Sally, she got sick,  
And I'm feeling mighty ill, myself.  
It happens all the time, and all through the night.

And I'm watching the ceiling fall down on her body,  
As she's lying 'round on the ground.  
  
Said: ""oh, babe got to celebrate,"" all through the night.  
Made me feel so sad, I cried all through the night.  
I said: ""oh, Jesus,"" all through the night.

And some people dream of things, they've never been done.  
They do it, oh, baby, all through the night.  
  
The city's funny and the country's wide,  
But I want to know why they don't have a right?  
Don't they do it, oh, baby, all through the night?  
Oh, mama, oh, mama, tell me 'bout it,  
All through the night.  
I want to have it all through the night.  
Christmas comes only once a year.  
  
Why can't anybody shed just one tear?  
For things that don't happen all through the night.  
Oh, mama, all through the night.  
Oh, baby, do it to me all through the night.  
Easy, easy, baby, why don't you give it to me?

Don't be afraid  
You just have to trust  
I have been there in the place you stand  
There's no need to fear  
That's why I'm here  
Give me your hand  
How can I repay you?  
You truly saved my life  
The Savior smiled  
And He said, That's alright  
Tomorrow when you're climbing  
Look around you on the way  
There are many others to be saved...  
Crying, Is anybody out there?  
Anybody there at all?  
Reach out to them, remember me, and call,

There's no need to fear  
That's why I'm here  
Give me your hand

Ship of white light in the sky, nobody there to reason why.  
Here I am, I'm not really there, smiling faces ever so rare.  
A let's walk in deepest space, living here just isn't the place.  
  
Stalks of light come from the ground, when I cry there isn't a sound.  
All my feelings cannot be held, I'm happy in my new strange world.  
Shades of green grasses twine, girls drinking plasma wine.  
A look at love, a dream unfolds, living here, you'll never grow old.  
  
Don't you hear me call? Oh

If you run, you condemn yourself and they'll realize now  
Then you'll be hurtin' me

24791,The Beatles,Jingle Bells,/b/beatles/jingle+bells_20225189.html,"Dashing through the snow, in a one-horse open sleigh  
Over the fields we go, laughing all the way  
Bells on bob-tail ring, making spirits bright  
What fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight  
  
[Chorus:]  
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way!  
O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh  
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way!  
O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh  
  
A day or two ago, I thought I'd take a ride  
And soon Miss Fanny Bright, was seated by my side  
The horse was lean and lank, misfortune seemed his lot  
He got into a drifted bank and we got upsot  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
A day or two ago, the story I must tell  
I went out on the snow, and on my back I fell  
A gent was riding by, in a one-horse open sleigh  
He laughed as there I sprawling lie but quickly drove away  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Now the ground is white, go it while you're young  
Take the girls tonight, and sing this sleighing song  
Just get a bob-tailed bay, two-forty as his speed  
Hitch him to an open sleigh and crack! you'll take the lead

It's not a secret or anything  
You're not alone in being alone  
At the end of a perfect day

Then they will gain their independence  
Don't make a martyr of yourself  
It's just the end of a perfect day

I never really knew you anyway

Just want to tell you that it's over

Do you want sign language?  
Don't want a knuckle sandwich!  
Now you can love or you can hate it's just  
The end of a perfect day  
  
You can't get inside someone  
So don't ask me if we're close  
I really couldn't tell you  
But I know you wouldn't really listen anyway  
  
It's a pain you have to bear  
And it's always going to be there  
But if you disappeared tomorrow  
Then the world would carry on without you anyway  
  
Mind over matter it seems  
Can stop you falling apart at the seams  
It's a matter of honour with me  
I could write out a hundred times  
  
Put my hand on my heart and say  
That I don't want to lie  
Don't want to lie  
Don't want to lie  
About the way it is  
  
I want to tell you something  
Don't act surprised now or anything  
Now you can revel in yourself 'cause  
It's just the end of a perfect day  
  
No it's not a pretty world out there  
With people dying of their own despair  
But in a written testimonial you'd say  
You never really knew them anyway

It's a battle with the bottle  
I'll win it alright  
But I lost another round  
In the bar last night  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yeah, I'm gonna get fired  
For drinkin' on the job  
Got caught with the boss's wife  
In the parking lot  
  
I'm gonna get killed  
For doin' this again  
But I just can't help it  
It's under my skin  
  
I'm a dirty old man  
I do what I can  
I'm gonna get hammered  
And do it again  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Got a bag of frozen peas  
I use on my knees  
I injured from beggin'  
And tryin' to please  
  
If you believe that  
I'm losing my fat  
Got a workout program  
And a new rubber mat  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm a dirty old man

9119,James Taylor,New Hymn,/j/james+taylor/new+hymn_20069195.html,"Source of all we hope or dread  
Sheepdog, jackal, rattler, swan  
We hunt your face and long to trust  
That your hid mouth will say again let there be light  
A clear new day  
But when we thirst in this dry night  
We drink from hot wells poisoned with the blood of children  
And when we strain to hear a steady homing beam  
Our ears are balked by stiffled moans  
And howls of desolation from the throats of sisters, brother, wild men  
Clawing at the gates for bread  
Even our own feeble hands  
Aim to seize the crown you wear  
And work our private havoc through  
The known and unknown lands of space  
Absolute in flame beyond us  
Seed and source of Dark and Day  
Maker whom we beg to be  
Our mother, father, comrade, mate  
Til our few atoms blow to dust  
Or form again in wiser lives  
Or find your face and hear our name  
In your calm voice the end of night  
If dark may end  
Wellspring gold of Dark  
Be here  
Be now

All the years of talking,  
All the years of sharing the space.  
If we don't open our souls to each other,  
There's nothing in between us.  
  
I remember your eyes,  
Reflecting the skies.  
Waiting for the boat to come,  
Waiting for the boat.  
  
Writing the script of life,  
Playing the guessing game,  
Hurting from love and fear.  
If we don't open our souls to each other,  
There's nothing in between us.  
  
Some day when your boat is here  
And you're way out there,  
You may remember the summer clouds  
And that I tried to reach you.

Feeling the pressure from all the things I gotta face today.  
All of my days, are totally crazy can't do nothing right.  
It's an ordinary day.  
Every minute feels like an hour slowly creeping by.  
All of this stress but I do my best to keep it all in stride.  
I need to decide.  
I need to unwind.  
All these things are on my mind  
It's an ordinary day.

Things are crazy but it's all right.  
You make me feel alright again.  
When it rains you are the sunshine.  
That lights me up from deep with in.  
I can finally treasure this love beyond a measure.  
You given me the pleasure of an ordinary day  
Pounding the pavement.  
Another engagement.  
Gotta make it there on time.  
Hitting the side walk  
Hearing the small talk of people passing by.  
Wondering why.  
Gotta rewind.  
Think I gotta clear my mind.  
It's an ordinary day.  
What are the chances I've locked glances with a passer by.  
Oh, a stranger must be an angel cause he smiled.  
I wonder if he knows anything I know that there is life  
In an ordinary day.

And baby I think of you  
Day in and day out  
  
Day out, day in

When I awake I get up with a tingle  
One possibility in view  
That possibility of maybe seeing you  
  
Come rain, come shine  
I meet you and to me the day is fine  
Then I kiss your lips, and the pounding becomes  
An oceans roar, a thousand drums  
Can't you see it's love, can there be any doubt  
When there it is, day in, day out

If I fuck up, forgive me  
I'm a fool, I'm a fool, I'm a fool, yeah he,  
Yeah, yeah  
  
I'm a fool, hundred thousand for the jewels  
Last year we killed the game  
And left y'all browsing for the clues  
Old niggas out here searching for that fountain of the youth  
Money talks and hoes say it's... point of view  
Don't make me act a fool like Malcolm before the suit  
How can you justify, I testified and there's proof in it  
Through out the years, she'd tears and spill truths  
Somehow they love a nigga better  
When he talk about is loot  
Chain like a kaleidoscope, see light through a wider scope  
And for I know this necklace really represents the news  
Still I hit the jeweler, how much racks to make me cooler  
I just play the game homie, I ain't making rules up  
Started from the bottom, same way you lace your shoes up  
So if I'm blowing cake, just blame it on the place I grew up  
Where niggas had nothing but dreams and television  
Got no plans of seeing hella prison  
You can tell I'm living, right  
I'm a fool  
Never said I'm living right  
Such a fool, for you!  
  
Boy you a fool, boy you a fool  
Boy you a fool, and they like  
And they like, and they like  
Boy you a fool, boy you a fool  
Boy you a fool, and they like  
And they like, and they like  
  
Hey, I'm a fool, hunned thous to go to school  
... debt me, and my mama dared me  
Drowning in the pool  
The first to go to college  
They say knowledge is the truth  
But these hoes on campus, make a young nigga drool  
So we party skip class, get ass and talk cool  
Meanwhile she back home work hard  
I use that as my few  
So I finally graduated,  
But I'm sad to say it, I ain't learn a fucking thing  
Except the game and how to play it  
I'm a fool, no... on my shoes  
No cuts out on prove  
So fuck y'all reviews  
She told me Cole I love you roll with you before the riches  
But you way too educated to be calling women bitches  
And calling brothers niggas  
Pardon if I cross the line  
But all the time thought you was different than  
All them other niggas  
I responded to her please don't put me on a pedestal  
Cause I know better  
And I'm still a fool

Never knowing when you're to fall,  
Sure as hell beats never gambling at all.  
  
Life's too short to just barely exist,  
Wide spread mediocracy,  
Will suck you up, resist,  
Another number on a list.  
  
I don't want it, you can have it,  
You can try, but you won't make me,  
Feel the things you feel,  
I'll take my chances, 'til I find a better deal,  
I'll take my chances, along with all the rest.  
  
The snail goes over the razor blade,  
The suicide squad of lemmings parade,  
To their kingdom, where they've made reservations.  
  
I have no reservation,  
And I don't think my seat's been saved,  
I'll take my chances, here, right.

One conclusion I have made  
Is God don't own a car

He'd rather take the bus  
He would pay a tourist fare  
So he could sit with us  
He don't have no tamborine  
Guitar or slide trombone  
The music we make here on earth  
The words they are his own  
And when we finally reach his home  
And walk among the stars  
He'll join our band then we'll understand  
Why God don't own a car

That makes her know just how she feels

You hunt me down, you haunt me  
And beg me to believe  
  
All too fast to where she goes  
But who'll be first to find her name  
And holding on in Hollywood  
But holding on don't make the grade  
  
Just about when it's all right  
There's you and I : we'll find our way  
But it's holidays not Hollywood  
And holidays don't suit my game.  
  
'Cause you're the biggest thing  
That I see  
You've got me where you want me  
You hunt me down and haunt me  
And beg me to believe  
  
Hollow days and hollow nights  
But everyone they find their way  
It hightlights you when things ain't right  
And makes you want to find your place  
  
'Cause you're the biggest thing  
That I see  
You've got me where you want me  
You hunt me down, you haunt me  
And beg me to believe

You've got me where you want me

Streets of gold, fame and fortune?  
You didn't fancy working in a factory  
But your mum and dad didn't agree  
  
You slept on Waterloo station at first  
But now you've moved to a posher squat  
You wonder where your next meal will come from  
Still it's better than living at home  
  
You're looking tired 'cause it's been three weeks  
Since you changed your clothes or washed your feet  
But you're learning fast all the time  
How to cadge cigarettes and pills  
  
I don't condemn what you done  
I know what it is to be young  
You're only searching for today  
To see the answers about yesterday -  
And I hope you find

And all the thoughts I've had  
They reflect just what I'm learning

Yes, I say it is to stay on top  
On top of a world forever churning

But I can see that your eyes are glass  
Well, do you see, can't you see, what I'm feeling?  
Yes, I've seen your face before  
Why, I've seen it everywhere  
Showing up to me without a scent revealing  
  
Well, I said will it ever change?  
Will it stay the same?  
I'd surely like to know before it's over  
Well, I said I played some  
I said it won't be long  
Won't be long before I stop and play it over

He played that rock and roll  
A leaper and a bounder  
Down to his gypsy soul  
The music was his angel  
And sorrow was his star  
And those of us who follow  
Might hope to reach as far

Speechless in D.C.  
There's no way I could tell you  
What he meant to me  
  
Your mother's a survivor  
She'll do what must be done  
Her children will revive her  
And help her see the sun  
She almost knew that unison  
But the singing stopped too soon  
Now she shares the silence  
With a man up in the moon  
  
To speak of missing persons  
Tonight there's only one  
And we all carry with us what the man's begun  
  
And you can sing this song  
On July the Fourth  
In the sunny south and the frozen north  
It's a day of loss, it's your day of birth  
Does it take a death to learn what a life is worth?  
  
Your brothers are all older  
And they'll take it in their stride  
The world's a little colder  
But manhood's on their side  
Now you're the little girl-child  
And you look so much like him  
And he's right there inside you  
Each time you want to sing  
  
Sing of missing persons  
Tonight there's only one  
But he's where you can find him when it's said and done  
  
And we will sing this song  
On July the Fourth  
From the sunny south and the frozen north  
This will always be your day of birth  
May you always see what your life is worth

So please don't you have a miracle just laying around  
One small miracle nobody needs  
Send it on down  
I'll never make it through this night  
Thinking she's with someone else  
Please don't you have just one small miracle left  
  
I know I haven't been a saint  
And asking you for anything takes nerve  
'Cause you've already blessed me with so much more in life than I deserve  
But if you can make a blind man see  
And change the water into wine  
Then surely you can keep her from tearing out this ol' heart of mine

And wraps a fucking ? onto my head and to my vest  
Walking down the stret, my next door neighbours not impressed  
I'm a robot and buying ten fags is my quest  
  
Eggsie's gone too far, he thinks he's robocop  
He's covered in tinfoil and he's got matching metal socks  
We tried to sedate him but he fucking escaped  
The man robot myth starts to escalate  
  
He tries to sell himself standing in curries  
But if the police turn up, he runs in a fucking hurry  
He tries to plug himself in the mains with his nob

I knew from then, I was a motherfucking robot  
Bill Gates from Microsoft, Stephen Hawking's voice  
And fucking Lara Croft  
  
I built a lab, secret in my loft  
And built a special costume that would help me to jack off  
I sat there in front of the screen  
For many years, this had been my wet dream  
Now I've reched it, I'm finally there  
Like terminator being filmed in Aberdare  
So alone, when people stop and stare  
Like C3PO but with pubes and hair  
  
Robot Love  
Robot  
Robotic Breakdancing  
Robot  
  
The doctors found a nut  
They said he was an headcase  
'cos he sticks silver and cans on his face  
  
Sucking off antennas and trying to fuck the fridge  
And burnt his pubic wig, with the high voltage  
  
I am a robot  
My prime directive is to's go to's the shops  
And buy's ten fags  
Do's you's compute?  
  
He wants to buy ten fags, his destination is the shops  
A tinfoil suit and a hat like Robocop  
If your ask him then he'll do a bodypop  
Like terminator, yeah he just won't stop  
  
Put electical cable down through the eye of his cock  
Plugged it in the wall and gave himself a big shock  
The reason that he did it wasn't to give himself pain  
Watching Terminator over again and again  
  
Fuck man, get him, fucking restrain him man  
get him fucking, fucking get him down man  
inject him man, get him down  
He's fucking nuts spa and he's losing it  
Help me man, just get him fucking....

See love's greatest non-believer  
Believing that she might be seeing love  
In your eyes  
  
Stars above  
Made for wishin', made for dreamers  
Won't you listen to this heart  
And what it's dreamin' of  
If they'll only shine their lucky starlight down on me  
Make it bright enough for only you to see

17916,Rod Stewart,No Holding Back,/r/rod+stewart/no+holding+back_20117615.html,"A friend of mine called up,  
said, ""I fin'lly had some luck-  
Could I have a minute of your time.  
I met a girl last night  
try as I might,  
I can't get her off of my mind.  
She walked in the room and right then I knew  
I fin'ly found somebody for me.  
But to tell you the truth,  
I don't know what to do.  
Should I go ahead or wait and see?""  
  
I said, ""Give it all you got,  
no holding back.  
Let a light in your soul.  
Ain't it better to lose in love  
than to never love at all?  
Than to never love at all?""  
  
Now I'm the kind of guy  
who's normally quiet shy.  
On romance, I don't know a thing.  
But when she led me to the floor,  
never danced before.  
Suddenly my feet had wings.  
I know that she wnats me,  
I want her too,  
but I'm so confused.  
I can't think straight.  
I feel so alive,  
but on the other side,  
should I go ahead or should I wait?  
  
I said, ""Give it all you got,  
no holding back.  
Let a light in your soul.  
Ain't it better to lose in love  
than to never love at all?  
Ain't it better to lose in love  
than to never love at all?"".  
Than to never love at all?""  
  
So, when the music starts  
to flow from your hearts  
like the coming of an early spring,  
whe nthe river starts to flow  
between your soul to soul,  
may no man ever come between.  
Die in her arms if she wants you to.  
Be thankful for each passin' day.  
When your odds collide,  
let your spirits fly  
and pray to God it's here to stay.  
  
And I said, ""Give it all You got,  
no holding back.  
Let a light in your soul.  
Ain't it better to lose in love  
than to never love at all?  
  
Give it all you got,  
no holding back.  
Let a light in your soul.  
Ain't it better to lose in love  
than to never love at all,  
than to never love at all,  
than to never, never love at all?""  
Ain't it better to lose in love  
than to never love at all?

25769,Bob Dylan,Ballad In Plain D,/b/bob+dylan/ballad+in+plain+d_20021147.html,"I once loved a girl, her skin it was bronze.  
With the innocence of a lamb, she was gentle like a fawn.  
I courted her proudly but now she is gone,  
Gone as the season she's taken.  
  
Through young summer's breeze, I stole her away  
From her mother and sister, though close did they stay.  
Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day,  
With strings of guilt they tried hard to guide us.  
  
Of the two sisters, I loved the young.  
With sensitive instincts, she was the creative one.  
The constant scapegoat, she was easily undone  
By the jealousy of others around her.  
  
For her parasite sister, I had no respect,  
Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect.  
Countless visions of the other she'd reflect  
As a crutch for her scenes and her society.  
  
Myself, for what I did, I cannot be excused,  
The changes I was going through can't even be used,  
For the lies that I told her in hopes not to lose  
The could-be dream-lover of my lifetime.  
  
With unknown consciousness, I possessed in my grip  
A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped,  
Noticing not that I'd already slipped  
To a sin of love's false security.  
  
From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace,  
Answers of emptiness, voice vacancies,  
Till the tombstones of damage read me no questions but, ""Please,  
What's wrong and what's exactly the matter?""  
  
And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen,  
The timeless explosion of fantasy's dream.  
At the peak of the night, the king and the queen  
Tumbled all down into pieces.  
  
""The tragic figure!"" her sister did shout,  
""Leave her alone, God damn you, get out!""  
And I in my armor, turning about  
And nailing her to the ruins of her pettiness.  
  
Beneath a bare light bulb the plaster did pound  
Her sister and I in a screaming battleground.  
And she in between, the victim of sound,  
Soon shattered as a child 'neath her shadows.  
  
All is gone, all is gone, admit it, take flight.  
I gagged twice, doubled, tears blinding my sight.  
My mind it was mangled, I ran into the night  
Leaving all of love's ashes behind me.  
  
The wind knocks my window, the room it is wet.  
The words to say I'm sorry, I haven't found yet.  
I think of her often and hope whoever she's met  
Will be fully aware of how precious she is.  
  
Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me,  
""How good, how good does it feel to be free?""  
And I answer them most mysteriously,  
""Are birds free from the chains of the skyway?""

How good it'd be to hold you  
How good it'd be to feel like that again

Would you be remembering me?  
I ask that question time and again  
The answer came and haunted me so  
I did not want to think it again

You make it hard for me to forget  
I haven't stopped loving you yet

She wore lemon  
But never in the daylight  
She's gonna make you cry  
She's gonna make you whisper and moan  
And when you're dry  
She draws her water from the stone  
  
And I feel  
Like I'm slowly, slowly, slowly slipping under  
And I feel  
Like I'm holding onto nothing  
  
She wore lemon  
To color in the cold grey night  
She had heaven  
And she held on so tight  
  
A man makes a picture  
A moving picture  
Through the light projected  
He can see himself up close  
A man captures color  
A man likes to stare  
He turns his money into light to look for her  
  
And I feel  
Like I'm drifting, drifting, drifting from the shore  
And I feel  
Like I'm swimming out to her  
  
Midnight is where the day begins  
Midnight is where the day begins  
Midnight is where the day begins  
  
Lemon  
See through in the sunlight  
  
A man builds a city  
With banks and cathedrals  
A man melts the sand so he can  
See the world outside  
Her there  
A man makes a car  
Destination  
And builds roads to run them on  
A man dreams of leaving  
But he always stays behind  
  
And these are the days  
When our work has come asunder  
And these are the days  
When we look for something other  
  
Midnight is where the day begins  
Midnight is where the day begins  
Midnight is where the day begins  
Midnight is where the day begins

She's imagination

But here in my heart is a memory  
The way we met, the way we kissed  
The way we fell in love  
Oh, the little secrets that we shared  
When I was sad, the way you cared  
To let me know you'd understand  
The way you'd hold my hand  
Cherished memories, the things that a fellow can't forget  
Cherished memories, you're leaving but I love you yet  
And now you say that we must part  
And even though it breaks my heart  
There's one thing you can't take from me  
That's my cherished memories

For the first time in I don't know when  
We were so close once upon a time  
There were five of us kids at home  
Two girls, three boys and Dad and Mom  
But that was in the better part  
Of life we left behind  
Remember that old swimming hole  
Where we would swim so long ago  
And all them possum grapes and muskedines  
And do you recall the time  
We all got drunk on homemade wine  
That was in the better part  
Of life we left behind  
  
Life was simple for us then  
If only it could be again  
How I wish we could go back in time  
But time moves on and nothin' lasts  
Except the memories from the past  
Memories from the better part  
Of life we left behind  
  
Remember how we talked as kids  
Of what we'd be when we got big  
And all the dreams that we held in our minds  
I wanted to be a singin' star  
And you all said that I'd go far  
But that was in the better part  
Of life we left behind  
  
Remember all the fun we had  
Back when they say times were bad  
And life was good to us and things were fine  
We had fun and we had love  
And a mom and dad to care for us  
But that was is the better part  
Of life we left behind  
  
Life was simple for us then  
If only it could be again  
How I wish we could go back in time  
But time moves on and nothin' lasts  
Except the memories from the past

Of life we left behind  
Sweet memories from the better part  
Of life we left behind

Your ghost by a coolebah sleeping  
Haunts you and whispers in your ear  
Give up give up this lonely road  
No one knows the promise you're keeping  
You can't touch the emptiness out here  
But the grace that mends this broken wing  
The blue sky to regain  
Will lift those feet and raise those eyes  
To face the desert again  
As the dawn reveals the journey's end  
In truth it's only beginning  
And it's as big as your eyes wish to see

More than I love you

And no man can ever say he does his woman better than I do you  
That ain't true (here's what I do)  
Send you fresh-cut roses every day of the week

Wrap my loving arms around you  
To reassure everything I felt that first night  
I feel it more

I wonder why I wonder how  
That it seems that the powers getting stronger  
Every day  
I feel a strength an inner fire  
But I'm scared I won't be able to control it anymore  
  
There's a time to live and a time to die  
When it's time to meet the maker  
There's a time to live but isn't it strange  
That as soon as you're born you're dying  
  
Just by looking through your eyes  
He could see the future penetrating right  
In through your mind  
See the truth and see your lies  
But for all his power couldn't foresee his own demise  
  
There's a time to live and a time to die  
When it's time to meet the maker  
There's a time to live but isn't it strange  
That as soon as you're born you're dying  
And reborn again?

She'll find the note I left hanging on her door.  
She'll laugh when she reads the part that says I'm leaving  
'Cause I've left that girl so many times before.  
By the time I make Albuquerque she'll be working.  
She'll probably stop for lunch and give me a call.  
But she'll just hear the phone keep on ringing, on the wall, that's all.  
By the time I reach Oklahoma she'll be sleeping.  
She'll turn softly and call my name out low.  
And she'll cry just to think I'd really leave her,  
Though time and time again I tried to tell her so.  
She just didn't know I would really go.

The rotting body clad in ancient clothes  
Is left behind with a wave of the hand.  
I have gone away. The bed is cold and empty.  
  
Trees bend their boughs toward the earth.  
And nighttime birds float as black faces.  
It was the hand reaching out through the mirror.  
Unknown and scarred by life...  
  
The luring eyes, you had never seen.  
You have nothing more to find.  
You have nothing more to loose.  
The cold season drifts over the land.  
  
They huddle in the brown corners.  
Some would settle for less.  
The castles were all empty, asleep.  
Long awaiting their king.  
  
Beckoning round the bend.  
Amidst the forest one would hear that I had been there.  
Draped within a fate I could not change,  
And always welcoming Winter's EPILOGUE.

They say I act like an asshole, when I pull up at the White Castle  
And I ask for an appli-cation, throw it back in her face an'  
Tell the bitch I'm a rapper, then I wack her  
In the head with a Whopper that I bought from BK  
You expect me to be proper?  
Bitch you better pop in a CD of me immediately, slut, ho Skidda dee da da  
Prada? Not a chance, I was thinkin' about buyin' you some clothes  
But Target was closed so I decided to mosey on over to K-Mart, but the doors  
Was locked, what about some shoes I thought, great I suppose  
So I go to Payless but what'dya know, they didn't carry a size eight in hoes!  
Oh! This is ugly boy swag, puttin' toe tags on you motherfuckin' ho bags  
What a trailer trash pioneer, I am here, that's why I'm here  
I don't got a rhyme book it's more like a motherfuckin' diary of diarrhea!  
Me, Yelawolf and Gangsta Boo came here to show you a thing or two  
'Bout sign language, middle fingers aimed at you  
So we don't gotta scream at you!  
Ow! I just bit my bottom lip, it was an accident  
I went to go tell 'em all to go get bucked!

I think that when you's in the war  
They always (hide 'n) play a song like that

Make destiny my own  
I learn to free my mind  
Myself I now must find  
Once more  
Once more  
  
If I could fly  
Like the king of the sky  
Could not tumble nor fall  
I would picture it all  
If I could fly  
See the world through my eyes  
Would not stumble nor fail  
To the heavens I sail  
If I could fly  
  
So here I am  
In solitude I stand  
I've got dreams inside  
I need to realize  
My faith has grown  
No fear of the unknown  
No more  
No more  
  
If I could fly  
Like the king of the sky  
Could not tumble nor fall  
I would picture it all  
If I could fly  
See the world through my eyes  
Would not stumble nor fail  
I could ravage my jail  
If I could fly

Whose life had passed upon the ocean  
  
Before light shook the sky  
Down by the docks I saw  
The masts unfolding  
Don't turn away, please understand  
It's a life and a living  
And a way to keep the wolves away  
From hungry hands, from hungry hands  
  
Crazy water  
Takes my fishing boat on Monday morning  
Dangerous dreaming  
If we all believe in the things you believe you're seeing  
Oh we'd never drop our nets in the crazy water, crazy water  
  
Tangled lives, lonely wives  
Shoreline widows pray  
For the souls of missing whalers  
Endless nights on an endless sea  
Where nothing lives between us  
Just the breakers on the ocean  
Separating you and me  
Separating you and me

Like hands that are praying the fire is saying,  
""You can burn down my churches but I shall be free.""  
  
A church is more than just timber and stone  
And freedom is a dark road when you're walking it alone  
But the future is now, and it's time to take a stand  
So the lost bells of freedom can ring out in my land.  
  
And a church is burning  
The flames rise higher  
Like hands that are praying a-glow in the sky  
Like hands that are praying the fire is saying  
""You can burn down our churches but I shall be free.""

Baby come what may  
Back from the twilight  
Should we lose our way  
As we were walking  
A hand should slip free  
I'll wait for you  
Should I fall behind wait for me  
  
Swore we'd travel together  
Darlin' side by side  
We'd help each other  
Stay in stride  
Each lover steps on  
So differently  
So I'll wait for you  
Should I fall behind wait for me  
  
Everyone dreams of  
A love lasting and true  
You and I know what this world can do  
So let's make ourselves be  
That the other may see  
And I'll wait for you  
Should I fall behind wait for me  
  
There's a beautiful river  
In the valley ahead  
There need be no drought  
Soon we will wed  
Should we lose each other  
In the shadow of the evening dreams  
Oh, I'll wait for you  
Should I fall behind wait for me  
Darlin' I'll wait for you  
Should I fall behind wait for me  
  
Wait for me  
If I should fall behind wait for me  
Wait for me

From the shame that was my own  
And I cannot begin to tell

Has taken all his blankets off the floor.

You're surrounded by confusion  
Saying life's begun to cheat you  
Friends are out to beat you  
Grab on to what you can scramble for  
Don't let the tears  
Just let me know  
I want to know  
I want to know you  
Well let me know you  
I want to feel you  
I want to touch you  
Please let me near you  
Can you hear what I'm saying?  
Well I'm hoping, I'm dreamin', I'm prayin'  
I know what you're thinkin'  
See what you're seein'  
Never ever let yourself go  
  
Hold yourself down, hold yourself down  
Why d'ya hold yourself down?  
Why don't you listen, you can  
Trust me,  
There's a place I know the way to  
A place there is need to feel you  
Feel that you're alone  
Hear me  
I know exactly what you're feelin'  
'Cause all your troubles are within you  
Please begin to see that I'm just bleeding to  
Love me, love you  
Loving is the way to  
Help me, help you  
Why must we be so cool, oh so cool,?  
Oh, we're such damn fools

56464,Widespread Panic,Pilgrims,/w/widespread+panic/pilgrims_20462347.html,"Black cat crossed our path on little fog feet  
There's crows flying beside my window  
We left superstition on the roadside a few cities ago  
They spent our souls, maybe, but they didn't take our smiles  
  
We listen, we shake, the radio  
  
There's a sweet corn princess smiling through the words on the glass  
Remember we stopped for tamales last time?  
But now the lights from the town are fading with radio  
There's another song playing, and we can hear it in the wind outside  
  
We listen, Pilgrims  
We shake, to the radio  
We listen, to the radio  
  
Little black kitty crossed our path wearing little fog feet  
And the crows they're just drifters through my window  
The late night city's lights are growing sharper  
And I hear another song, I see it pouring from the look in your eyes  
  
We listen,  
We shake, to the radio  
Pilgrims, we listen, we shake, to the radio, the radio
