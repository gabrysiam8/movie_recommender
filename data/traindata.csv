Not with your love within my reach  
I did not come this far to falter  
And will not rest until I'm free  
You are the sun, you are the flower  
You are the wind across the sea  
And I will kneel here at your altar  
And pray you'll take my soul to keep  
Oh, precious one, you are the mountain  
You are the earth beneath my feet  
In you we're one now and forever  
In you I find the love in me  
Through your love my eyes are open  
Through your love I'll learn to see  
And in your name my bread is broken  
By your grace I'll rest in peace  
I will not drown in shallow water  
Not with your love within my reach  
I did not come this far to falter  
And will not rest until I'm free  
Through your love my eyes are open  
Through your love I'll learn to see  
And in your name my bread is broken

You have love in your path before me  
But when your lips touched my lips  
It felt like I was kissing destiny  
  
Angel eyes with your angel eyes  
Will you always be there to hold me  
Angel eyes I'm satisfied  
I don't want to hear your story  
  
'Cause I can see the things  
I really want to see  
I'm in love  
I believe in what I'm feeling  
  
I'd give everything up just for you  
Love is devoted to those who see  
That the last dance, you dance with the truth  
Angel eyes with your angel eyes  
  
Will you always be there to hold me  
Angel eyes I'm satisfied  
I don't want to hear your story  
'Cause I can see the things  
  
I really want to see  
In your eyes  
Angel eyes just want you here to hold me

Reconcile us to Himself, through Christ Jesus.  
We will be free, forever knowing what will become... of us.  
Thank you for the cross.  
Trusting in the balance has tilted me towards righteousness.  
Lifting my spirit once again, sinking not in my functioning.  
Inhale, exhale this over and over again.  
Looking for tomorrow forgetting about today.  
Dying, dying.  
Through prayer and sacrifice into all the earth,  
With love and understanding.  
Now I look to importance, standing here steadfast,  
To renew (the? or Your?) spirit within me.  
Do not cast me from Your presence,  
Or take Your Holy Spirit from me

Would it matter to you  
If we just took a walk  
To see where this path leads to  
Maybe stop in awhile  
Lay down, see you smile  
Looking up at those clouds in view  
  
It doesn't matter that the sky isn't blue  
A walk in the woods will do  
Sometimes it's better just being alone  
Being alone with you  
  
With the snow in your hair  
A crystal halo you wear  
While the chill winter air streams through  
Amid the birch and the oak  
Smell the fireplace smoke  
And the warmth we will go home to  
  
It doesn't matter that the sky isn't blue  
A walk in the woods will do  
Sometimes it's better just being alone  
Being alone with you  
  
Oh whoa...  
  
It doesn't matter that the sky isn't blue

Sometimes it's better just being alone  
Being alone with you

Honey Honey looks like a superstar  
Shes got a promise of lovestruck fascination  
  
What am I to do?  
How am I to know?  
Who are you. She shimmers  
Like a california sunset  
Honey, honey glitters but  
Theres no gold she carries  
Sweetly infectious magic  
Formulas, so delerious  
Is she that serious? Is she bringing me on?  
I've been waiting so long  
  
And this love, fool, osophy  
Is killing previous illusions that I had in my mind  
About you seems so true  
All the lies your telling tragically compelling  
And my love means nothing to you so  
Maybe I'm still a love fool  
I don't want to be a love fool  
I don't want the world  
I want you!

Treated like a Queen, she was  
On borrowed self esteem  
  
She would do a dance  
A painful masquerade  
Spinning you into her web  
Along her vain parade  
  
In her uniform  
Studded brass and steel  
Kissing lipstick, napkin stains  
And smearing sincerity  
  
Along her vain parade  
Along her veins  
  
Time crept up on her  
She's early gray  
Her reflection looks concerned  
As flowers hit her grave

I can't excuse it on the grounds of youth,  
I was no babe in the wild, wild wood.  
She didn't mean it,  
I should have seen it,  
But now it's too late.  
  
I thought I'd found the girl of my dreams,  
Now it seems,  
This is how the story ends:  
She's gonna turn me down and say,  
""Can't we be friends?""  
I thought for once it couldn't go wrong,  
Not for long,  
I can see the way this ends:  
She's gonna turn me down and say,  
""Can't we be friends?""  
Why should I care though she gave me the air,  
Why should I cry,  
Heave a sigh,  
And wonder why,  
And wonder why?  
I thought I found the gal I could trust,  
What a bust, this is how the story ends:  
She's gonna turn me down and say,  
""Can't we be just friends?""

Your thorns, they kissed my blood  
  
Your beauty heals, your beauty kills  
And who would know better than I do?  
Pretend you love me!

When a rose is in love with you  
Slaves of our hearts, that's what we are  
We loved and died where roses grew  
  
They watched us silently  
  
A rose is free, a rose is wild  
And who would know better than I do?  
Roses are not made for love  
  
Come like the dusk  
Like a rose on the grave of love  
You are my lust

The world had turned me down  
Then you picked me up and you kissed me sweet  
You changed a beggar into a king.  
  
Yes, you took the rags from off of my back  
And you gave me your love to keep me warm  
Yes, you picked me up and you kissed me sweet  
And changed a beggar into a king.  
  
I had walked the streets with my head bowed low  
The sun for me would never shine  
Then you came along into my life  
And changed a beggar into a king.  
  
Yes, you took the rags from off of my back  
And you placed a crown on my head  
Yes, you picked me up and kissed me sweet  
You changed a beggar into a king.

The wave comes and lies down wearily  
With a fan every day  
The old one makes the water smooth  
  
I throw the stone for fun  
The water moves in circles  
The old one looks sadly at me  
And swept it smooth again  
  
In the white sand, the old man  
Trembling, smokes his pipe  
Only the water and I know  
Why he needs this fan  
  
The idea sleeps like a volcano  
Hesitating, I asked him then  
His head bent, it seemed he slept  
He said before he died  
  
The water shall be your mirror  
If it is smooth you will see  
How many fairy tales remain for you  
And you will plead for your redemption  
  
The fan pressed against his body  
The hand stiffens with rigor mortis  
They had to break his fingers  
The fan remains back in the sand  
  
I call the old one every day  
He would like to redeem me  
I remain back in the midday's wind  
And I can read in the fan  
  
The water shall be your mirror  
If it is smooth you will see  
How many fairy tales remain for you  
And you will plead for your redemption

We wasn't babies, she just wanted to hold us  
And we ain't get disciplined, her friend started whisperin'  
About how she was a bad mama, mama said ""fuck 'em then""  
I was in the streets styling, nobody could tell me nothing  
Grandpa or grandma, not my auntie or my favorite cousin  
I was buzzin'  
Fucking all these hoes wearing no condoms, no nothing

I used to sneak and smoke stress weed

Know my family love me  
Riding in the car with 2 niggas and a pistol  
This ain't funny, I do it all for the money, hold up  
Slowly as I pull up to the donut stand  
I already know the plan, hop out and get on your mans  
And take what he got  
Go through pockets, wallets and socks, dig all the knots  
This a stick-up  
Phone ring, it's my mama in the middle of some drama  
So I don't pick up thinking I gotta get my shit up  
I gotta pick my bitch up  
Let's hurry up and leave, I feel the police near us  
So we left with a thousand dollars cash  
It was me and my nigga so you know I went half

So you grind and grind  
And you push and shove  
And claim that those most worthy  
Will get what they deserve  
What they deserve  
  
It can't be true  
It can't be true  
Because I've seen too many hungry faces  
I've seen too many with the likes of you  
It can't be true

You give nothing away for free  
If silence were truly golden  
I guess no one could sleep  
No one could sleep  
  
You have money at your fingertips  
People at your beck and call  
And you're fool enough  
To think for a price  
You can have the whole wide world  
  
For all our sake's  
And all our lives  
We must hope the words  
That come from your lips  
We must hope those words are lies  
  
For all our sake's  
And all our lives  
We must hope the dreams  
Soulless visions that you have  
Are never realized  
  
So  
You've got a big house  
And you drive a fancy car  
So what if your pockets are full  
If you have an empty heart  
  
You snap your fingers  
And all the waters part  
So what if the people bow down  
If they show you no regard  
  
Your left hand  
Always watches your right  
So what if you trust in god  
If you can't sleep at night  
  
You think you've made it  
You think you've got what everyone wants  
So what if you're a big fat man  
With an empty little heart  
  
Who has made a little money  
Off of somebody else's sweat  
Who watched the people starve  
While you got fat  
While you got fat  
You got fat  
You got fat

Narrow mind, full of hate,  
On the road to nowhere fast,  
Until the grace of god got in the way,  
Then he saw the light and hit his knees and cried and said a prayer,  
And rose up a brand new man, and left the old one right there.

Against the grain,

But all she could think about is a,  
A better life, a second chance,  
And everyone she's lettin' down.

Through good and bad  
And things we won't forget

But we always made it through somehow  
But the key to you is broken in the lock  
And a simple band of gold is all we've got  
It's in the things that I can't say  
That tear us both apart  
But if you keep listening  
You'll hear inside my heart of hearts  
Darling, the simple things are hard to say  
And darling the words get in the way  
The poet sees the world through rhymes  
But only says so much  
See darling, the words are in my touch  
The meaning's in my touch  
And maybe there's something I should say  
To make everything that's wrong Ok  
A simple phrase, a sonnet from a play  
But a man can only say so much these days  
And we're drifting to the deep end of the lake  
Trying to make good on our past mistakes  
And I know you're tired  
But heaven's here and now  
I've got no explanation  
Words are worthless to me now

You sail across the oceans  
You climb the Himalayas  
Seeking truth and beauty as a natural state  
You're a queen reborn  
Worshiped from above, afar  
Some see you as an elixir  
An elemental natural, seeking perfect grace  
In a catacomb  
Or cave of endless drawings  
Prehistoric or religious  
Your accomplishments prodigious  
Seeking out the perfect tone  
Your language so clear  
Your voice perfectly turning  
As in the city, I sit yearning  
Blowing rings of smoke from thin cigars  
Or driving fast in foreign cars  
To capture your remains  
You're an adventurer  
A turban wet, wrapped 'round your head  
On the mountainside, they predict your death  
Oh, how you fooled them all  
But subjects are a poor excuse  
When what you really want's a muse  
An inspirating knowledge of what comes before  
Speeds of light  
The momentary flicker of a candle in its wicker basket  
Smoking wax - facts!  
Did you find that superior knowledge that eluded you in college?  
Did you find that super vortex that could cause your cerebral cortex  
To lose its grip?  
You're an adventurer  
You were out looking for meaning  
While the rest of us were steaming in an inspirating urban pit  
An adventurer  
You enter as I'm dreaming  
I wish I'd never wake up  
Differentiating, scheming from my one true love  
You're an adventurer  
You love the angles and the cherries  
The height and width of levies  
The natural bridge and tunnels of the human race  
You're an adventurer  
Nothing seems to scare you, and if it does, it won't dissuade you  
You just will not think about it  
You dismiss it and defocus  
You redefine the locus of your time in space - race!  
As you move further from me, and though I understand the thinking  
And have often done the sane thing, I find parts of me gone  
You're an adventurer  
And though I'll surely miss you  
And of course I'll survive without you and maybe good will come of that  
But at this point I anticipate some grieving  
And although I know your leaving  
Is a necessary adjunct to what we both do  
An adventurer  
Splitting up the atom  
Splitting up the once was  
Splitting up the essence  
Of our star-crossed fate  
None who meet you do forget you  
My adventurer, my adventurer  
My adventuress

People think I'm insane because I am frowning all the time  
All day long I think of things but nothing seems to satisfy  
Think I'll lose my mind if I don't find something to pacify  
Can you help me occupy my brain?  
Oh yeah  
I need someone to show me the things in life that I can't find  
I can't see the things that make true happiness, I must be blind  
Make a joke and I will sigh and you will laugh and I will cry  
Happiness I cannot feel and love to me is so unreal  
And so as you hear these words telling you now of my state  
I tell you to enjoy life I wish I could but it's too late

Well it wasn't really a hotel, it was a patio  
Bar with funky rooms and an outdoor disco  
With bad wiring. Some people said if you looked

Some say it was a rock

There were models from Paris  
There were locals and New Yorkers  
And the Brazilian Navy

Girl at the pool table  
Puts on a show for free  
They were bivouacked in the bathroom  
By the hot tub near the sea  
  
Every night at midnight  
Seems the devil took control  
And the hill became a parking lot  
Fueled by rock 'n' roll  
  
They were talking by the cannon  
But I couldn't believe my ears  
The Russian had plutonium  
The sailor wanted beers  
  
They shook hands in the moonlight  
And broke out a big cigar  
Just business as usual  
Beneath the tropic stars

It was better than a painting  
At le Musee de Beaux Arts  
And simply what we did for fun  
Back in the old St. Barts  
  
Then the glitz and all the glamour  
Hit like a hurricane  
Or maybe we just all grew up  
But it never was the same  
  
The gendarmes finally closed the joint  
And the fire it did the rest  
But on New Year's Eve of '91  
We sang the last request  
  
We were dancing in the ashes  
We were dancing in the sea  
We were dancing in the ruins  
Where we left our memories  
Come on let's go alors  
Vien faire un tour autour do rocher

Up to his golden eye  
And boogied through the vestibule  
While bidding us goodbye  
The enemy surrounds us  
And our spirit's almost gone  
The Devil take the cavalry  
That sold us for a song  
  
There's Chi-Chi's on the starboard, lads  
And Chi-Chi's in the stern  
And hashish in the hookah pipes  
And bonny grass to burn  
Our mission is a secret  
But we're fool enough to try  
We'll sail the bloody ocean, boys  
Or drink the bastard dry  
  
""If I'd've been a carpenter,"" the swarthy  
Sergeant said  
""I'd never seen this ugly thing  
That hangs above my head  
The hell with all your heros  
And the wounds they hope to show  
I'm just a simple soldier, son  
With one more year to go""

And the cook was in a stew  
The filthy little cabin boy  
Was whizzing in my shoe  
The Captain's wife was aging  
And the first mate heard her scream  
When Tommy slipped tabasco in the  
Captain's vaseline  
  
""Our time will soon be gone"" he said  
""It's all we've left to lose  
We've shot our ammunition  
And we're all but out of booze  
So here's to Irma Donegal  
Here's to Nellie Blye  
And here's to my old friend,"" he said  
And kissed his ass goodbye  
  
""Give off! give off! You sorry lot.  
Give off!"" the Captain cried  
""We've lost our bloody anchor  
And we're driftin' with the tide  
The swollen surf is pounding  
Like a thousand cannons roar  
And I shake the hand of any man  
Who guides us into shore.""  
  
""We're saved! We're saved!""  
The soldiers said  
""We're saved!"" the sailors cried  
And soldiers climbed aboard  
While sailors left from either side  
Some swabbies hit the minefield and  
The rifles got the rest  
And somewhere there's a schooner  
Sinkin' slowly in the West.

It just hit me as I lay my head down,  
No one around,  
In the dark cold night, I hear a sound  
In my head keeping track of everything you've ever said.  
Must be something, but it's nothing, so I just go back to bed.  
  
It's four, crack the door to the hallway of my dreams,  
But it seems that my hallway keeps closing in on me,  
Forcing me out,  
Making me think about you and how you're gone.  
I see four o'five with teary eyes and then I write this song.  
  
[Chorus]  
And I just can't believe that it has to be this way,  
You know we say it seems to me that it was just the other day,  
I saw your face, I saw your light, you ran the race, you fought the fight,  
But now it's all being torn down for me tonight.  
  
And I know it might be a little selfish for me to say,  
But I need to know if you thought of me at all today,  
'Cause everyday, I walk past the place you left five days of the week,  
And now it's ten after four, and I am taken by sleep.  
[End Chorus]  
  
Spending hours on end  
Deciding what I'd say to a friend  
If I ever saw 'em again,  
  
'Cause I don't know if I know, and don't wanna come across the wrong way.  
'Cause I don't know if I know, but I know I wanna see your face today.  
  
Then somebody told me they saw you cry and break down.  
Do you know how hard that is to get around and think about?  
It's not like you to let emotions get the best of things,  
Especially when everything is hanging in the air we breath.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'll sing a song to you, my friend.  
I'll sing a song to you, my friend.  
I'll sing a song to you, my friend.  
I'll sing a song to you, my- Let's go!

And as I was searchin' from bottle to bottle for somethin' unfoolish to say  
That silver tongued devil just slipped from the shadows and smilingly stole
her away  
I said hey little girl don't you know he's the devil he's everything that I
ain't  
Hidin' intentions of evil under the smile of a saint  
All he's good for is gettin' in trouble and shifting his share of the blame  
And some people swear he's my double and some even say we're the same  
But the silver tongued devil's got nothing to lose I'll only live till I die  
We take our own chances and pay our own dues the silver tongued devil and I  
Like all the fair maidens who've laid down beside him  
She knew in her heart that he'd lied  
But nothing that I could have said could've saved her  
No matter how hard that she tried  
Cause she'll offer her soul to the darkness and danger  
Of something that she's never known  
And open her arms at the smile of a stranger who'll love her and leave her
alone  
And you know he's the devil...

Took you unaware.  
  
And you can weep and sigh,  
You can say, ""unfair"".  
You can almost die of despair.  
But if love ain't there,  
It ain't there.

But no where is not so hard to bare

And I fished the salty waters for a time.

I could see the rocks and cliffs of solid stone.  
Listening to the seagulls calling to each other  
Made me miss my darling and my distant home.

Through the valleys and the forests,  
To the sunshine of her smile,

The Atlantic disappeared on the horizon,  
And Quebec lay waiting for me down the track.  
For a while I drove a truck to keep from star-ving.  
In Ontario I was a lumber-jack.  
  
Man-itoba and Saskatchewan then followed,  
Where the wheat fields and the old Red River flowed.  
In the quiet hours your whistling on the prairie,  
Touched my heart and set my memories aglow.  
  
I could feel the nearness of her warm, sweet kisses,  
When you rolled into Alberta westward bound.  
I worked on an oil rig to make some money,  
For a ticket to the sweetest girl around.  
  
Pushing on past Lake Louise in all it's splendor,  
Where the trees and Rockies touch the sky above,  
I got to British Columbia and heaven,  
On your track I made it back to my true love.

The coming days of failure  
Aborting evolution  
In quest of power

Take what's hers and these blood skies will reign

These bloody skies will reign  
Dear savior brace your heart

Sunsless skies

Black hearts how reign  
Blasphemous corruption  
Controlling progression

This future of despair is easy to avoid  
This future of despair is easy to avoid  
Lies strangle this world hope

to gamble on love just one time  
I never thought, that I would get caught  
It seemed like the perfect crime

Baby you left me defense-less  
I've only got one plea  
Lock me away, inside of your love  
and throw away the key  
I'm guilty...of love in the first degree  
  
I thought it would be so simple  
like a thousand times before  
I'd take what I wanted, and just walk away  
but I never made it to the door  
  
Now babe I'm not beggin' for mercy  
go ahead and throw the book at me  
If lovin' you's a crime  
I know that I'm as guilty as a man can be

Tied to my little world

And love would never end

The innocence of youth  
Maybe only in their blind belief  
Can we ever find the truth

And wars would never start  
  
And time would heal all hearts  
Every man would have a friend  
And right would always win  
And love would never end

I knew she was the one who could change my mind  
  
See, I used to be such a bad, bad boy  
And good times were my toy for joy  
That was all I was thinking of

I used to know the party people around the world  
I gave it up when I found that girl  
And she's the one treats me good enough

To only see the world through my eyes  
And that it was a waste of time  
Talkin' 'bout love  
But it only took a little time  
To make me change my mind  
'Cause when she said goodbye  
See, I really thought I'd never stop crying

All of my friends say oh I'm such a different guy

Throw you in the back seat, slam the door  
No stoppin' as down the road you go  
Got not time to lose  
  
Gigantic one-way gate ahead  
You're thinkin', man, I'd as soon be dead  
They decided to give you life instead  
The sanitarium blues  
  
Big ol' nurse all dressed in white  
Slaps you on a table in the middle of the night  
Then he straps you down real tight  
You're wonderin', what'd I do?  
  
They hose you down, make sure you're clean  
Wrap you up in hospital green  
Shoot you full of Thorazine  
The sanitarium blues  
  
Could be TB or maybe a tumor  
Eavesdropping on the doctors, listening to the rumors  
Can't see your friends, hear the hum of the wheels  
Hey, my man, you know how it feels  
Like the sanitarium blues  
  
Then upon some sunlit day  
They figure there's no need for you to stay  
They're pretty sure you can't be cured  
So they send you on your merry way  
  
You hit the pavement, hang around  
Nobody's on the outside to be found  
You're just tryin' to stay above the ground  
You start to thinkin', what's the use?

I raise a toast to you

Why don't you try being kind  
  
They've decided to become  
A little more proactive  
Creep upon you while you sleep  
And make you less attractive  
  
Born without a spine  
Why don't you try being kind  
  
For those out drinking their mother's wake  
You'll find a way to soldier on  
For those whose love evaporates  
I pray you find where you belong  
  
Oh the words I have repressed  
Are coming out today I guess  
It's justice not respect I'm after  
And that just leaves comtempt  
For you all  
  
I am just a simple man  
With simple expectations  
With deep regrets they're seldom met  
God speed my generation  
  
And with Crowley on my mind  
I should try being kind  
  
For those about to die we salute you  
For those of about to cry we love you

For those of about to cry we love you

I'm feelin' the strain  
Ain't it a shame?

Oh, give me the beat, boys, and free my soul  
I want to get lost in your rock-'n'-roll and drift away  
Give me the beat, boys, and free my soul  
I want to get lost in your rock-'n'-roll and drift away  
  
Beginin' to think that I'm wastin time  
And I don't understand the things I do  
The world outside looks so unkind  
I'm countin' on you to carry me through

And when my mind is free  
You know a melody can move me  
And when I'm feelin' blue  
The guitar's comin' through to soothe me  
  
Thanks for the joy that you've given me  
I want you to know I believe in the song  
And rhythm and rhyme and harmony  
You helped me along  
You're makin' me strong

Bad moon is rising again  
Dice rolls and you burn  
Come down I fear  
As that cold wheel turns  
I know what I know  
Sad Claude's been sleeping around  
To stroke the right nerve  
Whose needs do I serve  
As Catherine's wheel turns  
  
She was always the first to say gone  
She's got her Catherine wheels on  
Always the first to say gone  
  
Go kindly with him  
To his blind apparition  
His face creases up  
With age gone grey  
He'll back here one day  
  
She was always the first to say gone  
She's got her Catherine wheels on  
Always the first to say gone  
She's got her Catherine wheels on  
Wheels on  
  
Catherine wheels  
Catherine wheels  
Catherine wheels  
  
She's gone  
Vanished in the night  
Broke off the logic of light  
He woke  
Tore the covers back  
Found he was empty inside  
  
So they were told  
When the moon would rise  
The best time to leave with your soul  
She's gone  
But towards the light  
Watching her whole life unfold  
Bruises come out dark  
  
So strong was his hold on her  
Regarded by some as his slave  
He spoke as in a stranger's tongue  
Despair us and drive you away, hey  
Bruises come out dark

Said Tommy the Cat as he reeled back to clear whatever foreign matter  
May have nestled its way into his mighty throat  
Many a fat alley rat had met its demise while staring point blank down  
The cavernous barrel of this awesome prowling machine  
Truly a wonder of nature this urban predator  
Tommy the Cat had many a story to tell  
But it was a rare occasion such as this that he did  
  
She came slidin' down the alleyway like butter drippin' off a hot biscuit  
The aroma, the mean scent, was enough to arouse suspicion in even the  
Oldest of tigers that hung around the hot spot in those days  
The sight was beyond belief  
Many a head snapped for double--even triple--takes as this vivacious  
Feline made her her way into the delta of the alleyway where the most  
Virile of the young tabbies were known to hang out  
  
They hung in droves  
Such a multitude of masculinity could only be found in one place  
And that was O'Malley's Alley  
  
The air was thick with cat calls (no pun intended)  
But not even a muscle in her neck did twitch as she sauntered up into  
The heart of the alleyway  
She knew what she wanted  
She was lookin' for that stud bull  
She was looking for that he cat  
And that was me  
  
Tommy the Cat is my name and I say unto thee  
  
Say, baby, do you want to lay down with me?  
Say, baby, do you want to lay down by my side?  
Ah, baby, do you want to lay down with me?  
Say, baby?  
Say, baby?

Queen Latifah is five-oh on this set

For God so loved the world he gave to me  
I'm coolin teaching those needing schoolin  
The mic, this mic in my hand, I'm rulin  
So prepare your mind for my lifeline

And dive into the wrath of my madness

There are those who like my taste, but don't consider biting  
There's penalties for those who don't do writing, just be reciting  
Everyone else's word that took a lot of thinking  
It's not my fault your thoughts are shrinking  
while mine are growing, yes you know like all the woman inside of me  
Despite what you do or say, and even in spite of me

The voice is too vicious, the same as the pace

The shrinked-to-fit buttonflies fit quite snug  
As a bug, you know why? Because I'm bugging  
Of the beats that DJ Mark is loving  
So plex on the sounds that I'm pumping  
I'm jumping with the energy to turn your mind to gladness  
Come on, just get into it, don't lie and say you've been through it  
Feel the wrath of my madness

I scene is mine cause I took it  
I took it for the money and I took it for the fun  
Don't step up in my face, you don't want to feel the taste  
Don't try and play me out, cause I am not the one  
Brothers on my brastrap, sisters clocking my sound, why?  
Because they want to be down with the  
Queen L-A-T-I-F-A-H in command  
I supply the concept for you to understand  
For those who want to bite, don't make me have to fuss  
The only thing you get is the gluteous maximus  
Suckers on the tip, you're loving me, you're leaving me  
You wish that one day you could have this  
Come on, you know the time, just be thankful for the rhyme  
And get up on the wrath of my madness

Underneath us all  
There's a world that we always forget 'til it moves us  
Where the moon on the bay dances all alone  
Ramone, he draw the razor swift, it slice the air  
No more lovely dreams of those summer nights  
Down in santo domingo  
They laugh and play in the sleepy harbor town  
So unaware of the danger that's around  
Livin' on the fault line  
Livin' on the fault line  
Livin' on the fault line  
Livin' on the fault line  
No one can run when it finally comes down  
Nobody knows what is stirrin' underground  
Caruso stumbled  
While the city tumbled down  
The palace was in splinters  
Theodore was leaving town

Keeping track of every minute that remains

Burning bright for everyone of us who's lost

Rise on up knowing

When you came up from Burma to stay.  
And you told me I ought to travel with you,  
You were sure it would be OK.  
When I asked how you earned your living,  
I can still hear what you said to me:  
You had some kind of job on the railway  
And had nothing to do with the sea.  
  
You said a lot, Johnny,  
All one big lie, Johnny.  
You cheated me blind, Johnny,  
From the minute we met.  
I hate you so, Johnny,

Why am I feeling so blue ?  
You have no heart, Johnny,  
And I still love you so.  
  
At the start, every day was Sunday,  
Till we went on our way one fine night.  
And before two more weeks were over,  
You thought nothing I did was right.  
So we trekked up and down through the Punjab,  
From the source of the river to the sea.  
When I look at my face in the mirror,  
There's an old woman staring back at me.  
  
You didn't want love, Johnny,  
You wanted cash, Johnny.  
But I sewed your lips, Johnny,  
And that was that.  
You wanted it all, Johnny,  
I gave you more, Johnny.

There is nothing that we need  
In a world of persecution that is burning in its greed

Has all been meant for you  
  
I'm looking for someone to change my life  
I'm looking for a miracle in my life  
And if you could see what it's done to me  
To lose the love I knew  
Could safely lead me through  
  
Between the silence of the mountains  
And the crashing of the sea  
There lies a land I once lived in  
And she's waiting there for me  
But in the Grey of the morning  
My mind becomes confused  
Between the dead and the sleeping  
And the road that I must choose  
  
I'm looking for someone to change my life  
I'm looking for a miracle in my life  
And if you could see what it's done to me  
To lose the love I knew  
Could safely lead me to  
The land that I once knew  
To learn as we grow old  
The secrets of our soul  
It's not the way that you say it when you do those things to me  
It's more the way you really mean it when you tell me what will be

have made me who I am today

And have been here for me through it all  
I've been through a lot but I've always known me

See in the flame of life  
And my spell is our lie

Taste the love  
The Lucifer's magic that makes you numb  
The passion and all the pain are one  
You're sleeping in the fire  
Taste the love  
The Lucifer's magic that makes you numb  
You feel what it does and you're drunk on love  
You're sleeping in the fire  
  
I gaze and the flame and fire burn  
And cry out the name of which I yearn

The passion and all the pain are one

We'll keep on climbing, looking over it all  
Laughing it up, yeah having a ball

On paths where she's leading me  
With games that she likes to play  
And words that she doesn't say

A reflection of you  
A reflection of me  
And it's all there to see

And waits to encompass me

As the evening sky grew dark  
Took a sniff of toncho from his coke can  
And headed through Balboa Park  
Where the men in their Mercedes  
Come nightly to employ  
In the cool San Diego evening  
The services of the border boys  
  
He grew up near the Zona Norte  
With the hustlers and smugglers he hung out with  
He swallowed their balloons of cocaine  
Brought 'em across the Twelfth Street strip  
Sleeping in a shelter  
If the night got too cold  
Runnin' from the migra  
Of the border patrol  
  
Past the salvage yard 'cross the train tracks  
And in through the storm drain  
They stretched their blankets out 'neath the freeway  
And each one took a name  
There was X-man and Cochise  
Little Spider his sneakers covered in river mud  
They come north to California  
End up with the poison in their blood  
  
He did what he had to do for the money  
Sometimes he sent home what he could spare  
The rest went to high-top sneakers and toncho  
And jeans like the gavachos wear  
  
One night the border patrol swept Twelfth Street  
A big car come fast down the boulevard  
Spider stood caught in its headlights  
Got hit and went down hard  
As the car sped away Spider held his stomach  
Limped to his blanket 'neath the underpass  
Lie there tasting his own blood on his tongue  
Closed his eyes and listened to the cars  
Rushin' by so fast

When I felt the need  
For a life of my own  
I dreampt of summer love  
And moving high up north  
But no one would go  
So I walked up the hill and lay there  
Imagining the day was near  
I know I want to stay there  
And be a great pioneer  
  
I made a promise then  
That I'd find a place  
Where my world won't end  
Give me a piece of land  
That will be my life  
That I will defend  
If I work really hard  
I will surely survive  
I know my virtue is strong  
No one could oppose a spirit so raw  
To be a part of the state  
To be known as a great pioneer  
I keep the fires burning  
To let you know I'm free  
My heart will always be yearning  
  
To be, a part of the state  
To be, a part of the state  
To be, known as a great pioneer  
  
And if it all should end  
And I hear the call  
From the great unknown  
I'll need to go my way  
Let me have my day  
Let me be alone  
  
I was dreaming here and lay there  
Knowing that my time is here  
I know I wanna stay there

Melihat mayat yang membusuk  
Tutup hidung sesekali meludah  
Aku lihat orang menangis  
Disela gaduhnya suasana  
Segera aku menghampiri  
Dengan bimbang ku bertanya padanya  
Rupanya yang mati sang teman  
Teman hitam hidup sepaham  
Hanya kisah yang dilewati  
Ia berdua ikat tali saudara

Panas terasa bakar kepala  
Sisa darah orang yang mati  
Disimpannya didalam hati

You can see them hailing trucks down the open road  
You wave your thumb and you hop on board  
You ain't got no keeper you don't need a friend  
  
I betcha wish you were the same  
Yeah I betcha wish you were the same  
Have you seen the old men  
We lean on the walls  
Of salvation halls  
  
In the streets of your town  
We're just a little shady  
We get a little crazy  
In the streets of your town  
In the parks about sundown  
  
We lay our heads  
Our shoes are our pillow  
The grass our bed  
Don't need no keeper  
And don't need no friend  
I betcha wish you were the same  
Yeah I betcha wish you were the same

38279,John Prine,Donald And Lydia,/j/john+prine/donald+lydia_20074738.html,"Small town, bright lights, saturday night,  
Pinballs and pool halls flashing their lights.  
Making change behind the counter in a penny arcade  
Sat the fat girl daughter of virginia and ray  
  
(spoken:)  
Lydia  
Lydia hid her thoughts like a cat  
Behind her small eyes sunk deep in her fat.  
She read romance magazines up in her room  
And felt just like sunday on saturday afternoon.  
  
Chorus:  
But dreaming just comes natural  
Like the first breath from a baby,  
Like sunshine feeding daisies,  
Like the love hidden deep in your heart.  
  
Bunk beds, shaved heads, saturday night,  
A warehouse of strangers with sixty watt lights.  
Staring through the ceiling, just wanting to be  
Lay one of too many, a young pfc:  
  
(spoken:)  
Donald  
There were spaces between donald and whatever he said.  
Strangers had forced him to live in his head.  
He envisioned the details of romantic scenes  
After midnight in the stillness of the barracks latrine.  
  
[Repeat chorus:]  
Hot love, cold love, no love at all.  
A portrait of guilt is hung on the wall.  
Nothing is wrong, nothing is right.  
Donald and lydia made love that night.  
  
(spoken:)  
Love  
The made love in the mountains, they made love in the streams,  
They made love in the valleys, they made love in their dreams.  
But when they were finished there was nothing to say,  
'cause mostly they made love from ten miles away.

48991,Primus,The Ballad Of Buckethead,/p/primus/the+ballad+of+buckethead_20110956.html,"""who's this guitar-playing sonsa bitch? "", is a question common asked.  
On his head a bucket of chicken bones, on his face a plaster mask.  
He's the bastard son of a preacher man, on the town he left a stain.  
They made him live in a chicken house to try to and hide the shame.  
  
He was born in a coop, raised in a cage. children fear him, critics rage.  
He's half alive, he's half dead. folks just call him buckethead.  
  
Farmers would torment him as he snuggled with the hens.  
They'd hose him down with water, and steal his little friends.  
Now late at night he'd sneak off to the graveyard all alone,  
And play a soapbox guitar to the faces made of stone.  
  
Buckethead found his freedom at the age of 17,  
When he burned the chicked house down with a quart of gasoline.  
He did puppet shows on corners and bought a real guitar,  
And with the help of colonel sanders, he's bound to be a star.  
  
He was born in a coop, raised in a cage. children fear him, critics rage.  
He's half alive, he's half dead. folks just call him buckethead.

P is for Please, Please don't go!  
  
Stop the love you save may be your own.  
Someday you may be all alone.  
Stop it, save me girl. Baby you better stop  
The love you save may be your own.  
  
Darlin' take it slow or someday  
You'll be all alone. I'm the one who loves you.  
I'm the one you need. Those other guys will put you down,  
As soon as they succeed.  
  
Stop the love you save may be your own.  
Baby stop it,stop it, stop it,

He'll be waiting for that one mistake

Before we're through

Hiding in the daylight shadows  
Until it's time to say goodbye  
Wishing it could be alright  
Living with the loneliness  
From kiss to kiss  
  
Don't ask me now what's right or wrong  
I've been wondering since you came along  
We we're weak and love was strong  
Now there's nothing we can do  
  
So I'll meet you at the same old place  
I know it's worth it when I see you face  
Someday we'll disappear without a trace  
Baby that's the truth

I keep wondering, who's gonna pay  
I keep waiting for judgment day  
Some people's lives just get in the way

With the hunger of a lion, the strength of a sun  
I don't need to sweat it when the competition come  
Original style, like an eight of eight drum  
So I don't run the track, no, I make the track run  
My momma taught me words, my daddy built rockets  
I hold 'em both together now, tell me what I got  
It's a pretty small weapon, I can shoot it, I can drop it  
But learn to respect it 'cause you clearly can't stop it  
  
Like that  
  
It ain't over 'cause the sharks on the left side, the snakes on the right  
And anything you do, they wanna get a little bite  
It really doesn't matter if you're wrong or if you're right  
'Cause once they get their teeth in nothing really fights  
And razzle me I do it like I got nothing to lose  
And you can run your mouth like you could try to fill my shoes  
But steady little soldier, I ain't standing next to you  
I can lay it on the ground before you're even in my view  
Like that  
  
Give me the strength of the rising sun  
Give me the truth of the words unsung  
And when the last bells ring, the poor men sing  
Bring me to kingdom come

Blackout and rock to, give you what you need

Seperate the weak from the obsolete  
You're meek, I creep hard on impostors  
And switch styles on the dime, quick-witted y'all  
Quit tripping, I don't have time for your crying  
I grind tough, sucka, make your mind up  
Are you in the firing squad or are you in the line-up?  
Bang, bang, little monkey man playing  
With the big guns only get you slain  
I ain't playing, I'm just saying  
You ain't got a sliver of a chance  
I get ill or I deliver while you quiver in your parents  
So shake, shake down, money, here's the break down  
You can play the bank, I'ma play the bank take down  
And no mistakes now I'm coming to get you  
I'm just a Banksy, you're a Brainwash, get the picture?  
It's like that  
  
We swim against the rising waves  
That crash against the shore  
The body bends until it breaks  
The early morning sings no more  
  
So rest your head  
It's time to sleep  
And dream of what's in store  
The body bends until it breaks  
And sings again no more  
'Cause time has torn the flesh away  
The early morning sings no more

I talk to shadows from a lonely candle  
Recite the phrases from the wall  
I can't explain this Holy pain  
  
Six days ago my life had taken a tumble  
The orders came from high above they say  
A need to use me once again they've got my number  
Further the cause boy yes you know the game  
  
I'll wait here for days longer  
Till the sister comes to wash my sins away  
She is the lady that can ease my sorrow  
She brings the only friend  
That helps me find my way  
  
I search the past back to a time  
When I was younger  
A target for the new society  
Picked to displace the leaders  
Countering objectives  
Of this new underground reality  
  
Waiting for days longer  
'til sister comes to wash my sins away  
She is the lady that can ease my sorrow  
My love for her  
Will help me find my way

And I stood proud  
My mission changed the world  
It turned my life around  
  
I look around my room is filled with candles  
Each one a story but they end the same  
I'll hide away in here the law will never find me  
The walls will tell the story of my pain  
  
Waiting for days longer  
Till sister comes to wash my sins away  
She is the lady who can ease my sorrow  
She sets the pace for my delivery of pain  
  
They'll say my mission saved the world  
And I stood proud  
My mission changed the world  
The underground will rise and  
Save this world we'll all stand proud  
Our mission changed the world, we'll change the world

You see it started way back in NYC  
When I stole my first rhyme from the M.I.C.  
At a west end avenue at 63  
The beginning of a leap year, February, '96  
With a guitar picked up in the mix  
I committed to the licks like a nickel back of tricks  
Well look at me now

Where I've been been been  
And I have no regrets  
That I bet my whole checking account  
Because it all amounts to nothing up in the end  
  
Well you can only count on the road again  
We'll soon be on the radio dial  
And I been payin' close attention to the Willie Nelson style  
Like a band of gypsies on the highway while  
I'm one man pushin' on the California skyline drive  
Up the coast mc brag the most  
I'm pickin up my pace and makin' time like space ghost  
  
Raising a toast to the highway patrol with the most  
Put my cruise control on coast  
'cause I'm tourin' around the nation on extended vacation see  
I got Elsa the dog who exceeds my limitation  
I say, ""I like your style, crazy pound pup!  
You need a ride?  
Well come on, girl, hop in the truck!""

See I'm a down home brother, redneck undercover  
With my guitar here  
I'm ready to play  
And I'm s a sucker for a filly  
Got a natural ability to give the freestyle  
Look at my flexibility  
Dangerous at the mike  
My ghetto hat's cocked right  
The ladies say, ""yo, that kid is crazy""  
The backstage betties taking more than they can get  
They say, ""what's up with m-are-a-z?""  
  
Hey, hey, something's different in my world today  
Well they changed my traffic sign to a brighter yellow

Yes girl even when we don't feel strong""  
So how many young men have to lay down  
Their life and their love of their woman  
For some sick promise of a heaven

Even the four horses say all bets are off

We're on the dark side of the sun

Murder is what we talkin about, and always will be

Said Edith, as she filled his cup.  
""Nobody'll find you here,  
And Earl is glad you guys showed up.""  
""The way things are downtown,  
You might have to stay for awhile.  
  
There was a helicopter hovering over your house  
When I talked to your neighbor, Kyle.""  
""Who the hell do they think they are,  
Invading our home like that?  
Grandma and I had to leave so fast,  
We couldn't even catch the cat.""  
  
""The helicopter scared the shit out of him,  
And it took off down a trail,  
Down past the railroad track,  
Towards the county jail.""  
  
""Jed, you really screwed up now!  
What did you have to do that for?  
Everybody wants to hang your ass,  
And here's a note from Lenore.""  
Sun touched the cold steel bars  
As she pushed the paper in.  
Jed took it up and read it  
And he couldn't hide a grin.  
  
Outside the jail window  
A crow flew across the sky,  
Completely disappearing behind each bar,  
Then a helicopter flew by.  
""Say hi to Earl and Edith.  
Tell 'm I'm doing fine.  
Tell 'm it's time for them to let you go now,  
They should cut the line.""  
  
""Can grandma come and see me?  
I got a new song to sing  
It's longer than all the others combined  
And it doesn't mean a thing.""  
The noise was unfamiliar,  
Generators whirling,  
Walkie-talkies screaming,  
Vans parked in the open field.  
  
TV crews and cameras,  
They wanted to interview grandpa on the porch.  
They came through the gate and across the lawn  
Knocking down Edith's Tiki Torch.  
And grandpa saw them there,  
Looking through the venetian blind.  
""Those people don't have any respect,  
So they won't get any of mine.""  
  
""I don't wanna talk about Jed.  
I don't watch channel 2 or 6 or 9.  
I don't have time to talk that fast,  
And it ain't my crime.""  
  
""It ain't a privilege to be on TV  
And it ain't a duty either.  
The only good thing about TV  
Is shows like 'Leave it to Beaver.'""  
  
""'Shows with love and affection',  
Like mama used to say.  
A little Mayberry living  
Could go a long way.""  
  
He took Earl's shotgun down from the closet,  
Loaded up both barrels.  
Walked out on the porch and fired 'm off,  
And up walked a woman named Carol.  
  
""Susan Carol from Early Magazine,  
I got some questions to ask.""  
""Well you can stick 'm where the sun don't shine!""  
Grandpa said with a gasp.  
  
Then he fell face first and let out a sigh,  
And Edith ran out in shock.  
He was looking at her from down on the floor,  
Grandpa looked like he was trying to talk.  
  
""That guy just keeps singin'!  
Can somebody shut him up?  
I don't know for the life of me  
Where he comes up with that stuff.""  
  
They laid his head on a newspaper  
With a picture of Carmichael on the front page,  
Posing with the little league baseball team,  
And a seedy shot of Jed on a motorcycle.  
  
Grandpa died a hero.  
Trying to stop the media.  
Fighting for freedom of silence.  
Trying to be anonymous.  
  
Share your loving and you live so long.  
Share your loving and you live so long.  
Share your loving and you live so long.  
Live so long.

This isn't a party

You've kept us in the dark for long enough  
  
This is more than a party  
More than a party  
More than a party  
  
Keep telling us we're to have fun  
Then take all the ice cream so we've got none

And in an instant the laughter's gone  
  
Loads of surprises in store  
This isn't a party  
It's a whole lot more

Additional verse: Leonard Cohen  
  
I was dancing with my darlin'  
To the Tennessee Waltz  
When an old friend I happened to see  
Introduced him to my loved one  
And while they were waltzing  
My friend stole my sweetheart from me.  
I remember the night and the Tennessee Waltz  
Now I know just how much I have lost  
Yes I lost my little darlin'  
The night they were playing  
The beautiful Tennessee Waltz.  
She comes dancing through the darkness  
To the Tennessee Waltz  
And I feel like I'm falling apart  
And it's stronger than drink  
And it's deeper than sorrow  
This darkness she's left in my heart.

Another time, a lesson learned  
Another one, I crashed and burned

A small cafe and lots of noise  
A crowded place but just one voice  
And from that moment I saw your face  
I just knew...  
  
You, you make all my dreams come true

The finest thing I've seen

A shining star I see  
That heaven sent to me  
That heaven sent to me...  
  
I've been ignored, I've been deceived  
I hardly enjoyed the goals I achieved  
And what's the meaning of success  
That you can't share  
Although I'm used to be apart  
I'll never get used to a broken heart  
But when I see you I gladly  
Take that risk again  
  
You, you make all my dreams come true  
An angel smiled at me  
The finest thing I've seen

You, you make all my dreams come true  
A shining star I see  
That heaven sent to me  
That heaven sent to me...

I fell in love with you today  
I fell in love when I first saw you  
And I hope you'll see me too  
And if you don't I do, understand  
And that is ok, but I have never  
Felt this way  
  
You, you make all my dreams come true  
An angel smiled at me  
The finest thing I've seen  
Baby you, you make all my dreams come true  
A shining star I see  
That heaven sent to me  
That heaven sent to me

On the dock the fish were stinkin'

The children hum their Christmas carols  
The train tracks all run parallel

On a dusty pew in a vestibule  
Sits the Devil playing pocket pool  
He's waiting for the next poor fool  
Who forgot that it was Sunday

With our orange plastic button eyes  
In a former life on a motel chair  
I was Charlie Parker's teddy bear  
  
Yeah, me and Bird we'd stay up late  
I used to watch him contemplate  
While his horn would sit by the window and  
Wait till it was time for him to blow it  
  
On a dusty pew in a vestibule  
Sits the Devil playing pocket pool  
He's waiting for the next poor fool  
Who forgot that it was Sunday

Was ""Moonlight Bay on the Avenue""  
These are the tales from the Devil's chin

Ball park skinny ass well-fare aid  
Ulster and Bruce brothers we was the shit  
Dungeons Dragons, and Bruce Lee flicks  
Quit school nobody missed us,  
Nobody hugged and kissed us only dissed us

Takin' my dick in em  
You don't remember my kind in class  
The whipped out freak starin' at your ass  
Never had the courage to even say hi  
Only smell your perfume vapors as you walk by  
I'm the scrub that never crossed your mind  
Now your flashing your titties at me waitin' in line

You used to say ""Ahhh Hah!""  
Look at him the same pair of pants and that shirt again  
An outcast I knew I had to do something  
Figure out a way to make something out of nothin'  
Open up shop got what you need  
Speakers clothes CD's or bags of weed  
But that shit got me nowhere except jail  
Me and all my homies to broke to make the bail  
So now we're right back at the place we started  
Chuckles and laugh the second we turn our backs  
Assed out but we was like ""fuck y'all""  
We got each other and the drop of the homie call  
Look at us now bitch holdin' platinum  
All up on my dick but I'm the same as back then  
Forget the money and fame because  
Beneath the paint life's just as it always was  
  
Look at me!  
Analyze! What you see?  
Look at me!  
Analyze! What you see?  
  
Another girl I don't dare to confide in  
Playing that role it hurts inside  
Here I am thinking she wants me  
She only wants that killer on her CD  
Just when I couldn't feel any worse  
Bitch asked me if I could paint my face first  
The day I finally get to leave this land  
Behind the paint will be the shell of a used up man  
Behind the paint will be the shell of a used up man  
The shell of a used up man  
The shell of a used up man  
Behind the paint will be the shell of a used up man (Analyze!)  
The shell of a used up man  
The shell of a used up man  
Nothing left but the shell of a used up man  
Nothing left but the shell of a used up man

We circumvent this power that was so slowly bled from us

These crimes now lead to your numbered days  
Bulldoze their pedestals  
Ignite their fortress

Out drawn, out numbered  
To the ground we begin again

I'm always thinking in terms of do-re-mi  
I should be hiking, swimming, laughing with you  
Instead I'm all out of tune  
  
But what you don't know  
You lift me off the ground  
You're inspiration, you helped me find myself  
Just like a baseline in half-time  
You hold down the groove  
That's why I'm counting on you  
  
And if I heard you on the radio  
I'd never wanna change a single note  
It's what I'm trying to say all along  
You're my favorite song  
  
I'm in a session writing tracks  
You've got another class to teach  
And then rehearsal with a band  
You're always one step out of reach  
I'm looking for some harmony  
With you it comes so naturally  
You helped me find the right key  
  
And when I hear you on the radio  
I'd never wanna change a single note

Won't you take the time to explain  
Do you ever think you'd rather be with me instead  
Or do you only think about me when it rains  
  
We shared some special nights together  
We said we'd watch the morning rise  
But when the sun was all around us  
Wasn't nothing I hadn't seen in your eyes  
  
I try so hard to keep it hidden  
But I am hurting deep inside  
For every time I've seen you smile  
There are two times that I have cried

I will be waiting underneath the pouring rain

In a time unique, in a place divine  
Keep your eye on the Ikon  
Shining in the light of eternal mind.  
  
I went to sleep a blind man  
But when I awoke I saw  
The legions of the lonely  
See their faces, hear them call.  
  
See how they hang on  
Each one in a world of his own design  
Listen to the Ikon  
Ringing in the sound of eternal mind.  
  
And the music plays forever  
And it captures every ear  
And the sound of barriers crashing down  
Is the sweet harmony you hear.  
  
Still, be still  
To strong, so be still  
Much too long, come down  
Be still, look around  
Listen here, be still  
Hear the sound, be still.  
  
Still we are here  
We are still  
Will we sing sweet  
Sing we will  
Still we are here  
We are still  
Nil is a fear all is nil  
Still we are here we are still  
Spill it let go let it spill.  
  
The question comes to mind  
About what should be done  
And how much of the old will die  
That the new may be begun  
But you don't have to be afraid  
Of being alone with nowhere to run.  
  
You don't have to be afraid  
To look yourself in the eye  
You don't have to be afraid not to lie.  
  
Someone knows who you are  
Someone watches over you  
Someone knows how you feel  
And someone feels the same.  
  
So you don't have to be afraid  
Never fear, for you are living in eternal mind  
  
For those who still recoil  
For those who fear the pain  
Of peering o'er the edge of  
A new and different plane.  
  
You don't have to be afraid  
Whenever you go you come back again  
So you don't have to be afraid  
We live and we die  
You don't have to be afraid to know why.  
  
You do

She covers her ears when i play my guitar  
She runs away but not very far  
Just push a button - retractable cord  
I pull her back when i get bored  
One word from her and she'd be free  
But she's exactly where she wants to be  
Magnetic Madonna she glows in the night  
Reciprocal pull, i flow to her light

But what do i want to do?

Gotta get out  
Gotta get out  
  
I was walking  
I was walking into walls  
I'm back again  
I just keep walking  
I walk into a window  
To see myself  
And my reflection  
When I thought about it  
My direction  
Going nowhere  
Going nowhere  
  
No one...no one is blinder  
Than he who will not see  
No one...no one is blinder  
Than me  
  
I was talking  
I was talking in my sleep  
I can't stop talking  
I'm talking to you  
It's up to you  
  
Be my brother  
There is another way out of here  
In my brother  
Gotta get out  
Gotta get out  
Gotta get out of here

52117,Status Quo,Late Last Night,/s/status+quo/late+last+night_20244904.html,"I heard you come home late last night  
You moved so quietly  
Key in the door, light up the stairs  
But were you thinking of me?  
Don't want to lose you, don't want to harm you  
I just want to feel all right  
So how can I ask you who you were with last night?  
  
I listened to all your promises  
And lived with all those lies  
Pretending that I'm the only one  
When I've seen it in your eyes  
Maybe I need you, maybe it ain't true  
Maybe it's still all right  
So how can I ask you who you were with last night?  
How can I ask you who you were with last night?  
  
It's down to the feeling you get when you're with someone who really matters  
It's down to the love that you can show someone who really cares  
It's not up to you, it's not up to me  
Takes two people to agree  
It's down to the feeling you get when you're with someone who really matters  
  
Lately you and I ain't talked the way that lovers do  
Should accept the fact that maybe you've found someoe new  
If I could lose you, if I could hug you  
I'd still like to feel all right  
  
I wouldn't ask you who you were with  
I wouldn't ask you who you were with  
I wouldn't ask you who you were with last night  
I wouldn't ask you who you were with  
I wouldn't ask you who you were with  
I wouldn't ask you who you were with last night  
I wouldn't ask you who you were with last night

Another blooms in it's stead.  
A new love waits to open its eyes  
After the old love is dead.  
  
That sounds alright in a careless rhyme  
But there's seldom a second time  
  
Better luck next time  
That could never be  
Because there ain't gonna be no next time  
For me, no sirree  
  
Made up my mind  
To make another start  
I've made my mind up but I can't make up  
My heart  
  
I'd like a new lucky day  
That would be nice  
But this comes just once in a lifetime  
Not twice  
  
So don't say better luck next time  
That can never be  
Because there ain't gonna be no next time  
For me.

I ain't a thug either nigga, I just go along with it  
Fuck what the press tell you, listen to me  
I'm trying to tell you what's real, I don't live my life dangerously  
Live how I live, live by my rules  
You wouldn't survive just waking up in my shoes  
Yeah I dress like a thug, and talk like a gangsta  
But that don't mean I'm gonna clap at your crew  
Even if I strike rich, I'm stay with my crew  
I'ma stay with my peeps, I'ma stay in the streets  
I'ma keep spittin flames so my family could eat  
And now I'm not saying this to build my fan base  
And I don't give a fuck how many lives my hand takes  
And I'ma stay true to myself, I'm a man  
I'm a real nigga, hard to kill nigga  
Hard as a rock, I'm just Cris from the block  
Ya I'm that same troublemaking kid from the block (whut)  
[Verse 2:]  
I went from boy to man, ain't nobody gonn' stop me  
Holla Back nigga showing more hatred than the notzis  
I went from boy to man, from toys to guns  
Went from boy to man, from bottled milk to rum  
I went from boy to man, from the carriage to whips  
Now all the bitches wanna get married to Cris  
And there's Haze selling crack overseas,  
P. Diddy himself can't get rights to come and sample me  
You know I smoke to the sky and cook buckets of crack  
You that bitch ass that emptied out his budget for rap  
Biggs be the nigga that be running with gats  
Holla Back nigga, who else is fucking with that

What can't you take anymore?  
Expecting a whisper,  
I heard the slam of a door  
You say that all we ever do is fight  
Gee, I don't know that that's true.  
Then I wonder, am I right?  
Or is that part of our problem?  
Maybe I'm out of my mind.  
Maybe I'm blocking out the truth.  
But it seems like just a little thing,  
Like you don't want to listen,  
And I can't shut up.  
You don't have to smile at me.  
We don't have to talk.  
All that I ask is you stop,  
And remember, it isn't always this way.  
You have the problem,  
It comes with our private jokes.  
When you're in a fury,  
Laughter gets stuck in my throat.  
Sometimes I wonder why we have so much trouble  
Cheering each other up sometimes,  
When one or the other of us is down.  
Instead it's like, when you're in a bad mood  
I look at you and I say, maybe she's knows something  
I don't know, maybe I should be upset.  
You don't have to smile at me  
We don't have to talk.  
All that I ask is you stop  
And remember, it isn't always this way.  
The way that I feel  
When you laugh  
Is like laughing.  
The way that I feel  
When you cry  
Is so bad.

But it can't feel as cold as what you're feeling inside.  
  
And all of your friends are either married, vanished,  
Or just left alone.  
But that's no reason to just stop living.  
That's no excuse to just give in to a sad and lonely heart.

Don't forget to smile.  
Don't forget to dance, no, no, no,  
Forget it for a while.  
  
Cause darling, darling,  
I bet you danced a good one in your time.  
And if this were a party  
I'd really make sure the next one would be mine.  
Yes, you with the broken heart.

You walk down the street  
And all the young punks whistle at you.  
A nice bit of old,  
Just goes to show what you can achieve  
With the right attitude.  
As you pass them by  
They whisper their remarks one to another,  
And you give them the eye  
Even though you know that you could be their mother.  
You do the thing you love the most.  
What separates you from the rest,  
And what you love to do the most?  
And when they ask me how you dance,  
I say that you dance real close.  
  
Don't forget to dance, no, no, no,  
Don't forget to dance.

So they go driving  
Out to the river like lovers do  
You smell out the summer  
Baby, the summer just smells of you  
One day, I'm gonna be a famous writer  
Some book like love in the afternoon

Now here comes Lukas  
He done everything he wanna do  
It was twenty years later  
Come back to do what he promised to  
He come back to make her happy  
But these things don't always wait for you  
And poor Lukas was late  
That's when he got back, she'll be married today  
Gone away  
  
I thought we never last

For a million lonely people  
Another long gone  
For a million hearts that opened  
A million break  
And the world's just a fallen angel in my way  
I'm up in heaven, you can hear them say

Power, love and a sound mind.  
Strong in the Lord and the power of His might, I will  
Put on His armour and stand.

And chains stretched across all the entries to the inside  
There's a gate and a fence  
And bars to protect from only God knows what lurks outside  
Who stole your heart left you with a space  
That no one and nothing can fill  
Who stole your heart who took it away  
Knowing that without it you can't live  
Who took away the part so essential to the whole  
Left you a hollow body  
Skin and bone  
What robber what thief who stole your heart and the key  
  
Who stole your heart  
The smile from your face  
The innocence the light from your eyes  
Who stole your heart or did you give it away  
And if so then when and why  
Who took away the part so essential to the whole  
Left you a hollow body  
Skin and bone  
What robber what thief  
Who stole your heart and the key  
  
Now all sentiment is gone  
Now you have no trust in no one  
  
Who stole your heart  
Did you know but forget the method and moment in time  
Was it a trickster using mirrors and sleight of hand  
A strong elixir or a potion that you drank  
Who hurt your heart  
Bruised it in a place  
That no one and nothing can heal  
  
You've gone to wizards, princes and magic men  
You've gone to witches, the good the bad the indifferent  
But still all sentiment is gone  
But still you have no trust in no one  
  
If you can tear down the walls  
Throw your armor away remove all roadblocks barricades  
If you can forget there are bandits and dragons to slay  
And don't forget that you defend an empty space  
And remember the tin man  
Found he had what he thought he lacked  
Remember the tin man  
Go find your hear and take it back  
  
Who stole your heart  
Maybe no one can say  
One day you will find it I pray

This is my wooooooorld  
Z-Ro, king of the ghettoooooo  
[Z-Ro]  
Once upon a time, not long ago  
There was a hustling motherfucker, with a cold ass flow  
Everytime he hit the studio, his beeper go off  
He left the beef to get his cheese, by selling people that raw  
With a pistol on his right side, and one in his back  
I-10 again and again, from running that crack  
Girlfriend kept complaining, cause he never at home  
So he told her deal with it bitch, or get the fuck on  
It was money over bitches, on his mind  
Plus all of his partnas, thought that he would never shine  
The number be 15 and 5, up in the kitchen  
He could do it straight up, or he could do it with a whipping  
But then came a drought, and then he put his first album out  
Decided to do it full time, cause record stores kept selling out  
Still in the game, cocaine on top of the brain  
From the studio to the streets, Z-Ro is everything  
[Hook - 2x]  
[Z-Ro]  
King of the ghetto, I'm sitting on my throne  
Got a red light, sitting on my chrome  
Ridgemont Texas, representing  
With a taper fade, sitting on my dome  
I mash niggaz, and I trash niggaz  
When it come down, to the cash nigga  
Beat that ass, in a flash nigga  
Pistol play, and I'ma blast nigga  
Gangstafied, from Goderhead  
All day long, I chase my bread  
But on the low, I don't fuck with FED's  
Cause a snitch nigga, get dressed in red  
Shut up bitch, she look so lie  
But they don't know, she'll take your life  
Not giving a fuck, or get fucked up  
And end up dead, with your dick in the sky  
Go my way, we gon have fun  
Instead of happiness, we have done  
About our business, corrupting our kidneys  
All that codeine, weed and drugs  
I'm leaning over, but still a soldier  
Pimp my pen, like I'm suppose to  
Nothing but the finest, light green doja  
Got it from see-Note, from the Clover  
Animal thug, I thug for life  
So I ain't going, to the club tonight  
Block is bleeding, I'm here for the eating  
And supervising, my funds tonight  
I scuffle and hustle, on my grind  
No matter the weather, no matter the time  
Roll out the red carpet for Z-Ro, this world is mine  
[Hook - 2x]  
[Z-Ro]  
Who that bumping, who that beefing  
Hope you brought something, to put your chief in  
Interrupting me, while I'm reefer chiefing  
I'm a gangsta, not Erkle Steven  
Cause I don't laugh, and I don't play  
And no, is something that I don't say  
I don't give a motherfuck, about your day  
Hoe, get the fuck out of my way  
I'm lean as fuck, and don't like nobody  
My style of rap, is I'm like nobody  
I let off fo' shots, and hit fo' bodies  
OG with it, like Amas Rodney  
Still in the game, as a MVP  
Dealing with haters, that envy me  
Fuck fabricated, and commercializing  
I'ma bring my block, to MTV  
Show love, and do all I can  
For all my people, and all my fans  
But motherfuckers, be hating me  
For the life of me, I can't understand  
Cause I'm cool as hell, till a hater get bold  
Step out of line, fuck around get stoled  
I must be, their motherfucking issue  
Cause all these niggaz, getting drove  
Up a lot, like a Volkswagon  
I get a commission, for toe tagging  
A slim killa, with a wide body  
Polo top, and Polo sagging  
I live my life, like I don't care  
But every night, I be deep in prayer  
Then I get off, my knees  
And hustle, straight like that there  
[Hook - 2x]

There are souls that cry so deeply,  
To fill the emptiness we feel inside.  
We look around so hard to try and find,  
The kind of love we know that will survive.  
But here within a heartbeat,  
Is a love that so completely,  
Will take away the fear we try to hide,  
And even though we often wonder why,  
He gives us love so strong we can't deny.  
  
If the world lost all it's love,  
He would still have some to give you!  
And if the stars should lose their light,  
We'd still have His to hold back the night!  
This hope is mine,  
If the world lost all it's love,  
His still would shine!  
  
Hearts in need of kindness,  
Often stumble into blindness,  
When the dream world and the real world pull apart.  
It leaves us with a cold and empty heart.  
You'd think that we would know right from the start.  
  
If the world lost all it's love,  
He would still have some to give you!  
And if the stars should lose their light,  
We'd still have His to hold back the night!  
This hope is mine,  
If the world lost all it's love,  
His still would shine!  
  
Lost inside the hearts we hide,  
There's hope that He will take us in.  
To take away the suffering,  
And let new life begin.  
  
If the world lost all it's love,  
He would still have some to give you!  
And if the stars should lose their light,  
We'd still have His to hold back the night!

If the world lost all it's love,  
His still would shine!

But sing and dance and love for pennies and gold  
  
The juggling clown smiles to me  
And every frown we agree is glad  
The nighttime comes to bring the bums  
From Bowery heat to crimson streets of wine  
But magic lands will never touch our sands  
  
Your children smile in single file  
They learn mistakes that others make  
They see although they cannot know  
The needs they'll need to have their greed grow wild  
But dance and sing, for others bring the shame  
And for a while you won't know my name

I won't wait another minute  
We're on our way this time around  
  
And we won't go down  
  
I heard them say that dreams should stay in your head  
Well, I feel ashamed of the things that I've said  
Put on these chains and you can live a free life  
Well, I'd rather bleed just to know why I die  
  
[Chorus:]  
You can't say I didn't give it  
I won't wait another minute  
We're on our way this time around  
You can't say I didn't give it  
I won't wait another minute  
We're on our way this time around  
  
And we won't go down  
And we won't go down  
And we won't go down  
And we won't go down  
All I know is that fear has got to go  
This time around  
  
I've started feeling like I don't want to fight  
Give in to the given and put out the light  
Cannons a-blazin' shower these moonlit skies  
Then I remember and I know why he died  
Do you know why I die?  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
You can't say I didn't give it  
I won't wait another minute  
We're on our way this time around  
You can't say I didn't give it  
I won't wait another minute  
We're on our way this time around  
  
And we won't go down  
And we won't go down  
And we won't go down

For the first time in I don't know when  
We were so close once upon a time  
There were five of us kids at home  
Two girls, three boys and Dad and Mom  
But that was in the better part  
Of life we left behind  
Remember that old swimming hole  
Where we would swim so long ago  
And all them possum grapes and muskedines  
And do you recall the time  
We all got drunk on homemade wine  
That was in the better part  
Of life we left behind  
  
Life was simple for us then  
If only it could be again  
How I wish we could go back in time  
But time moves on and nothin' lasts  
Except the memories from the past  
Memories from the better part  
Of life we left behind  
  
Remember how we talked as kids  
Of what we'd be when we got big  
And all the dreams that we held in our minds  
I wanted to be a singin' star  
And you all said that I'd go far  
But that was in the better part  
Of life we left behind  
  
Remember all the fun we had  
Back when they say times were bad  
And life was good to us and things were fine  
We had fun and we had love  
And a mom and dad to care for us  
But that was is the better part  
Of life we left behind  
  
Life was simple for us then  
If only it could be again  
How I wish we could go back in time  
But time moves on and nothin' lasts  
Except the memories from the past  
Memories from the better part  
Of life we left behind  
Sweet memories from the better part  
Of life we left behind

It puts me in the mood  
It reminds me of, the first time I met you, girl  
And I hear the rain on the windowpane  
And it brings back memories  
Of the love we made  
And the things that we used to do  
Yes, and I recall the thrill of it all  
When the heat had just begun  
Everything was fine, nothing never did go wrong  
  
We had a strong love affair, strong love affair, baby  
From the very start  
We had a strong love affair, strong love affair, baby  
Then you broke my heart  
I didn't know what to do  
After lovin' you  
And I couldn't get a real good start  
We had a strong love affair, strong love affair, baby  
And I' m still missing you a lot  
So when I hear rain, it just brings back pain  
You gave the best love I ever had  
It's a doggone shame, 'cause it sure felt good to me  
Sometimes I wonder, where did you disappear to  
How did you get away, baby  
And I often think of you  
Do you ever think of me, baby  
Sometimes love don't work, the way you think it should  
When your love jones comes on down, baby  
But baby I still care and I think that I always will  
  
We had a strong love affair, strong love affair, baby  
From the very start  
We had a strong love affair, strong love affair, baby  
Then you broke my heart  
I didn't know how to act  
After your bags were packed  
And I couldn't get a real good start  
We had a strong love affair, strong love affair, baby  
And I'm still lovin' you a lot, oh well

At la-ya-ya-ya-ya-yast, at la-a-a-a-ast, oh at last, at last, oh

Again this is Mr. Ian Sheridan our friend.  
  
You know what that sounds like?  
Sounds like - love, (laughing) life's sweetest reward  
It's an open sword

Hey love, exciting and new (laughing)  
Come aboard, we're expecting you  
On the loooove boat (applause)

On the loooove boat oh-oh-oh

Into your room  
Where in deep sleep  
There you lie still  
To you I creep  
  
Then I descend  
Close to your lips  
Across you I bend  
You smile as I sip  
  
Now you are mine  
In my control  
One taste of your life  
And I own your soul  
  
Softly you stir  
Gently you moan  
Lust's in the air  
Wake as I groan  
  
In the dead of night

In the dead of night

Love bites you  
Invites you  
To feast in the night  
Excites you  
Delights you  
It drains you to white  
Love bites  
  
You knew at first sight  
You'd enjoy my attack  
That with my first bite  
There'd be no turning back  
  
So come in my arms  
I strike any hour  
I will return  
To trap and devour  
  
In the dead of night  
Love bites

Intoxicating laughter that spins you high and low  
Dangerous times are these, but oh so wonderfully new  
Laugh along you fool, can't you they're laughing at you  
Lost in the haze  
Of love's strange ways

Just a passion and a fool  
And a memory that burns  
And that's what you get

Hangs around a certain tree  
Singing serenades that tell his love is true

And when a cat on a fence  
Keeps his darling in suspense  
And he's brave enough to face a well-aimed shoe  
That's because it's the natural thing to do  
  
And you know every dove  
Has its heart set on love  
Rabbits, too, pet and pat  
And there's nothing wrong with that  
  
When a boy such as I  
Tries so hard to qualify  
With a very lovely lady such as you  
Can't you see it's the natural thing to do  
  
And then the girl she acts demure  
The boy he feels proud and sure  
So proud and sure that he impulsively suggests a rendezvous  
Fine thing  
That's because it's the natural thing to do  
  
But the girl she just won't agree  
She whimpers and she simpers  
And he begs on bended knee  
But she runs away because she knows full well he'll pursue  
The chump  
That's because it's the natural thing to do  
  
Then the boy in despair  
Waves his arms, tears his hair  
Stamps his feet and he acts like mad  
Then you know that he's got it bad  
  
Then the girl she ought to fall  
If she's got a heart at all  
She should take him in her arms  
And kiss him too

In armor coming,  
Saying something about a queen.  
There were peasants singing and  
Drummers drumming  
And the archer split the tree.  
There was a fanfare blowing  
To the sun  
That was floating on the breeze.  
Look at Mother Nature on the run  
In the nineteen seventies.  
Look at Mother Nature on the run  
In the nineteen seventies.  
  
I was lying in a burned out basement  
With the full moon in my eyes.  
I was hoping for replacement  
When the sun burst thru the sky.  
There was a band playing in my head  
And I felt like getting high.  
I was thinking about what a  
Friend had said  
I was hoping it was a lie.  
Thinking about what a  
Friend had said  
I was hoping it was a lie.  
  
Well, I dreamed I saw the silver  
Space ships flying  
In the yellow haze of the sun,  
There were children crying  
And colors flying  
All around the chosen ones.  
All in a dream, all in a dream  
The loading had begun.  
They were flying Mother Nature's  
Silver seed to a new home in the sun.  
Flying Mother Nature's  
Silver seed to a new home.

Like water risin' up to my chin  
Another long night to be alone  
I could go out on the town  
Talk too much and laugh too loud  
If I'm already on my way down  
I might as well just work the crowd  
  
Can you hear me now  
O the stories I could tell  
Sometimes I really hit my stride  
We make our own Heaven and our own Hell  
Tryin' to get across to the other side  
But everyday ends up the same  
One step up, two steps back  
Like some old silent movie frame  
Zoom in close, then fade to black  
  
Can you hear me now  
How did the load get to be  
so heavy I used to wear my trouble like a crown  
A bad flood's poundin' on the levee  
And I'm gonna need some help  
To hold my ground  
  
But I'm sinkin' like a stone  
To where in solitude this life I'll spend  
In the coldest place I've ever known  
I'm here just waitin' until the end I send up my S.O.S.  
A message in a bottle set out to sea It just reads

My Papa said everything's alright  
The doctor laughed,when mama laid down,  
With a stomach bouncing all around  
Mama gave birth to the hand-jive  
  
I could barely walk when I milked a cow  
When I was three, I pushed a plow  
While chopping wood I moved my legs,  
And I started dancing while I gathered eggs  
Townfolk clapped, I was only five  
he'll out dance em' all  
""He's a born hand-jive!""  
  
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah - everybody!  
  
Born to hand-jive, baby,  
Born to hand-jive baby- yeah!  
  
How low can you go?  
How low can you go?  
How low can you go?  
How low can you go?  
  
Higher, higher, higher and higher  
Now can you hand-jive, baby?  
Oh can you hand-jive, baby?  
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah  
Born to hand-jive, oh yeah!

Crying in lust

As demons come forth  
Death takes my hand  
And captures my soul

On the tide, on the tide, on the tide  
Tall treasures, large as Alaska  
There forever, never put out to pasture  
Then the night will fall  
Bringing peace to all  
Darkness there together  
Soft light bells and tea, draw the curtain  
China cups, some shatter for certain  
Laughin past pleasures warm by the fire

There's no need in playing games  
Cause after all we're all the same  
Just trying hard to lay it down  
  
Wish my words could make it well  
Wish that I could break the shell  
Take us from our self-made well  
Find a way to lay it down  
  
Burdened by the things I've learned  
I'm hurting because I'm too concerned  
Nonetheless I confess I yearn  
To find a way to lay it down  
  
Lay it down, lay it down

To make another run

On a winter's night  
Of his wake in the light of the moon

As he crawled up Fordger Bay  
And when they hit the spotlight  
It was like the light of day

When they told him to heave to  
He opened up the engines  
And he ran for Spanish Room

With the Mounties closing in  
His engines screaming murder  
And his face set in a grin

Like an angry banshee choir  
He hit the rocks at fifty clicks  
And the sky lit up with fire

From Fortune he did sail  
He rode the waves from St. Pierre

And you smell that French perfume

And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer  
But my breath fogged up the glass  
And so I drew a new face and I laughed  
I guess what I been saying is there ain't no better reason  
To rid yourself of vanity and just go with the seasons  
It's what we aim to do  
Our name is our virtue  
  
But I won't hesitate no more, no more

Little miss Strange  
  
Little miss Strange came out of the darkness  
Walked across my head, I stood beneath the light  
I'm talkin' 'bout the dream I had the other night  
  
Little miss Strange  
Little miss Strange

But I won't be home again.  
Maybe someday you'll have woke up,  
And, barely conscious, you'll say to no one:  
""Isn't something missing?""  
  
You won't cry for my absence, I know  
You forgot me long ago.  
Am I that unimportant?  
Am I so insignificant?  
Isn't something missing?  
Isn't someone missing me?  
  
[Chorus]  
Even though I'm the sacrifice,  
You won't try for me, not now.  
Though I'd die to know you love me,  
I'm all alone.  
Isn't someone missing me?  
  
Please, please forgive me,  
But I won't be home again.  
I know what you do to yourself,  
I breathe deep and cry out:  
""Isn't something missing?  
Isn't someone missing me?""  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And if I bleed, I'll bleed,  
Knowing you don't care.  
And if I sleep just to dream of you  
And wake without you there,  
Isn't something missing?  
Isn't something

Think I've been here before  
This place seems so familiar  
But then I can't be sure  
Here comes that time again when  
You'll walk right out the door  
Don't tell me secrets anymore  
  
And fools don't run away  
You'll be followed another day  
And all the chances that fall your way  
Are in the fire on your dying day  
So call me now and tell me that you're home  
  
Can't see the sense in crying  
There's too many tears to fall  
My thoughts are multiplying  
So I'll try to save them all

Lite in your head and dead on your feet

And forget about everything.  
  
These city streets make you feel so cold  
It's got so many people but it's got no soul  
And it's taken you so long to find out you were wrong  
When you thought it held everything.  
  
Used to think that it was so easy  
Used to say that it was so easy  
You're tryin', you're tryin' now  
Another year and then you'd be happy  
One more year and then you'd be happy  
You're cryin', you're cryin' now.  
  
Way down the street there's a light in his place  
You open the door he's got that look on his face  
And he asks you where you've been  
You tell him who you've seen  
And you talk about anything.  
  
He's got this dream about buyin' some land  
He's gonna give up the booze and the one night stands  
Then he'll settle down, it's a quiet little town  
And forget about everything.  
  
But you know he'll always keep moving  
Know he's never gonna stop moving  
'Cause he's rollin', he's the rolling stone  
And when you wake up it's a new morning  
The sun is shining it's a new morning  
You're goin' you're goin' home

Now reflections of a misery  
The hapiness I thought would last  
Now a becoming just a thing of the past

When Captain Jonas Psalter  
Sailed his ship to sea  
Anne Bonny kept him company  
  
The skull and crossbones flew  
Above the ocean blue  
The captain's men where a pirate's crew  
  
The ships they sought to take  
Were of the Spanish Main  
A gift from Ferdinand of Spain  
  
And though you rob and kill to find your dream  
Your crimes are hardly what they seem  
  
Tortuga held the treasure of a thousand kings  
So Jonas planned to steal everything  
  
Two hundred men stood guard  
Around the fortune's nest  
But Psalter's steel slew all the rest  
  
And when the smoke had cleared  
And bloody bodies lay  
Everyone could hear the minstrel play  
  
Woo woo Jonas Psalter  
You've captured every prize  
There is to dream of in one life  
  
And so we wonder why  
We found you in your bed  
With that bullet in your head

7993,Horrible Histories,Norman Family Tree,/h/horrible+histories/norman+family+tree_21067102.html,"[Intro]  
Here's the tale of me, Matilda,  
And my fight with cousin Stephen to succeed  
Henry first's throne.  
My wife's also called Matilda,  
Quite confusing 'cause we choose to claim  
Matilda's throne as our own.  
I'm Henry that Matilda's son.  
You got that?  
Here's the story of our spat.  
  
[Verse 1]  
Starts in 1135, when king Henry, my father, died,  
And I think you'll find named me, Matilda, as his heir.  
But his nephew, Stephen, said  
That crown should be upon my head!  
I'm a man and men come first.  
What? It's only fair.  
  
[Verse 2]  
Had married Geoffrey of Anjou,  
Stuck in France not Waterloo.  
When Steve without a voulez vous,  
Took throne from me.  
Should be dancing queen.  
Oh stop causing such a scene!  
  
[Chorus]  
Gimme, gimme crown and take a chance on me,  
I'm heir to the throne not you! Ah-ha!  
Think you'll get it back,  
Now that I'd like to see!  
  
Oh, I do, I do, I do!  
  
[Verse 3]  
Fought in Lincoln,  
She caught me.  
Was proclaimed first English Lady.  
But she made many enemies.  
Remember me? I'm Stephens wife.  
  
[Verse 4]  
Made royal councilors agree,  
That she lacked femininity.  
Took Stephens army and besieged her.  
Eugh! More strife!  
  
[Verse 5]  
I was trapped so faked my death!  
Hid in coffin, held my breath.  
Escaped!  
You think that I'm impressed?  
Well I'm not.  
Just look who I've got,  
Your half brother, want to swap?  
  
[Chorus]  
Gimme, gimme hubby and we'll fight again.  
The winner takes it all. Ah-ha!  
In Oxford I'll besiege,  
And I'll escape and then,  
I'll join the battle call.  
  
[Verse 6]  
Age 14, I fought but lost,  
So Uncle Stephen stayed as boss.  
Who should be ruler, mamma? Mia!  
Here we go again.  
  
[Verse 7]  
Sadly my darling Matilda,  
Caught a fever and it killed her.  
I gave up my dream  
To build a royal dynasty.  
When my son died,  
Had no heir which was a bind.  
  
[Chorus]  
Gimme, gimme crown 'cause next in line it's me.  
You can have it when I'm done. Ah-ha!  
So Empress Matilda never did make queen.  
The throne went to my son.  
  
Knowing Mum, knowing you.  
Everybody happy? Good!

To the mornin', my woman, and love.  
Tall pine trees are pointin' us easily to heaven above.  
Blue spruce clinin' to the grade in the evening  
They take the chill away fine.  
Cut the telephone line and the story's the same.  
  
There's a worn red chair by the window  
That we found at a sale down the way  
When some old women said that they  
Needed more room for the winter.  
People like pullin' at the stuffin' when they sit down.  
It helps passin' the time.  
Cut the telephone line and the story's the same.  
  
And oh, like a bubble on a windy day  
I start to flutter when I hear you say  
That you feel to good to go away.  
And you make me feel fine.  
And you make my world a warmer place  
By the sparklin' of your diamond face.  
On a frayed spot put a little lace.  
And you make me feel fine.  
Warm as the mountain sunshine  
On the edge of the snow line  
In a meadow of columbine.  
  
Oh little Jennifer, I'd give a penny for  
What you got on your mind.  
Seems like most of the time you're lyin' there dreamin'.  
Maybe in your visions you've seen how omniscient is  
Slightly less than divine.  
Cut the telephone line and the story's the same.  
  
Ripplin' water's flowin' through the pipes  
In the walls that are keepin' me warm.  
The closest I've been to my family for days is my music.  
Silently starin' at the mornin' sky  
It's just like hearin' her callin' my name.  
Cut the telephone line and the story might change.  
  
And oh, like a bubble on a windy day  
I start to flutter when I hear you say  
That you feel to good to go away.

He put her in a ranch house on a hill  
She could see the valley barbecues  
From her window sill  
See the blue pools in the squinting sun  
Hear the hissing of summer lawns  
  
He put up a barbed wire fence  
To keep out the unknown  
And on every metal thorn  
Just a little blood of his own  
She patrols that fence of his  
To a Latin drum  
And the hissing of summer lawns  
Darkness  
Wonder makes it easy  
Darkness  
With a joyful mask  
Darkness  
Tube's gone, darkness, darkness, darkness  
No color no contrast  
  
A diamond dog  
Carrying a cup and a cane  
Looking through a double glass  
Looking at too much pride and too much shame  
There's a black fly buzzing  
There's a heat wave burning in her master's voice  
Hissing summer lawns  
  
He gave her his darkness to regret  
And good reason to quit him  
He gave her a roomful of Chippendale  
That nobody sits in  
Still she stays with a love of some kind  
It's the lady's choice  
The hissing of summer lawns

Though I never knew you at all  
You had the grace to hold yourself  
While those around you crawled  
They crawled out of the woodwork  
And they whispered into your brain  
They set you on the treadmill  
And they made you change your name  
  
And it seems to me you lived your life  
Like a candle in the wind  
Never knowing who to cling to  
When the rain set in  
And I would have liked to have known you  
But I was just a kid  
Your candle burned out long before  
Your legend ever did  
  
Loneliness was tough  
The toughest role you ever played  
Hollywood created a superstar  
And pain was the price you paid  
Even when you died  
Oh the press still hounded you  
All the papers had to say  
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude  
  
Goodbye Norma Jean  
From the young man in the 22nd row  
Who sees you as something as more than sexual  
More than just our Marilyn Monroe

And dead men lay deep 'round the door

And the cold of a thousand snows  
Lay heaped upon the forests leaf

Fancy she would be  
And the fire of her longing would keep way the cold  
And her dress was a sight to see  
But the road was long beneath the feet  
She followed her frozen breath  
In search of a certain St John the gambler  
Stumbling to her death  
She heard his laughter right down from the mountains  
And danced with her mothers tears  
To a funeral drawn a calico  
'neath the cross of twenty years

The sun is shining  
But, it's raining in my heart  
  
No one understands the heartache,  
No one feels the pain,  
Cause no one ever sees the tears  
When you're crying in the rain,  
When you're crying in the rain,  
When you're crying in the rain,  
When you're crying in the rain  
  
The sun is shining  
But, it's raining in my heart  
  
No one understands the heartache,  
No one feels the pain,  
Cause no one ever sees the tears  
When you're crying in the rain,  
When you're crying in the rain,  
When you're crying in the rain,  
When you're crying in the rain  
  
Crying in the rain

There are unsmiling faces and bright plastic chains  
And a wheel in perpetual motion  
And they follow the races and pay out the gains  
With no show of outward emotion  
  
And they think it will make their lives easier  
For god knows up till now it's been hard  
But the game never ends when your whole world depends  
On the turn of a friendly card  
No the game never ends when your whole world depends  
On the turn of a friendly card  
  
There's a sign in the desert that lies to the west  
Where you can't tell the night from the sunrise  
And not all's the king's horse and all the king's men  
Have prevented the fall of the unwise  
  
For they think it will make their lives easier  
And god knows it's been hard  
But the game never ends when your whole world depends  
On the turn of a friendly card  
No the game never ends when your whole world depends  
On the turn of a friendly card  
  
But a pilgrim must follow in search of a shrine  
As he enters inside the cathedral...

And racked with pain,  
Tow that barge, lift that bail,  
Get a little drunk and you land in jail.

But scared of dying,

Bowl of oatmeal tried to stare me down... and won

And all my friends turned out to be insurance salesmen

Tryin' to get away  
From all the ears inside my walls  
I dreamed the police heard  
Everything I thought... what then?  
Well I went to court  
And the judge's name was Hoffman  
  
Ah but fortunately I have the key to escape reality  
And you may see me tonight with an illegal smile  
It don't cost very much, but it lasts a long while  
Won't you please tell the man I didn't kill anyone

When I crossed that room  
And I held her hand in mine.

And before too long, I fell in love with her.

Pretty as the answer to any man's dream  
  
From the start I gave Julie all the love that I've had  
Though everyone told me that Julie was bad  
Julie liked parties and clothes that fit tight  
Drinking and dancin' around late at night  
She was everything evil with the face of a child  
But I sat home and waited while my Julie went wild  
I had built me an empire with my own two hands  
With the money and power to break any man  
But with all my possessions power and gold Julie was one thing I couldn't
control  
I gave Julie all my money could buy begged her to love me but she wouldn't try  
She'd only laugh then walk out the door  
Each time she'd hurt me made me love her more  
  
Now I'm locked in this room they say I'm insane  
And I guess that I'll never see my Julie again  
I'm a man with a heart and a tormented soul  
And the mind that Julie drove out of control

Empty is the sky before the sun wakes up.  
Empty is the eyes of animals in cages.  
Empty, faces of women mourning  
When everything's been taken from them.  
Me, don't ask me about empty.  
  
[Sings:]  
Empty is a string of dirty days  
Held together by some rain.  
And the cold winds drumming at the trees again.  
Empty is the color of the fear  
Long about September when the days  
Go marching in a line toward November.  
Empty is the hour before sleep chills you every night  
And pushes you to take me away from every kind of light.  
Empty is me.  
Empty is me.

My hands kinda fumbled with her white plastic belt  
I'd taste her baby pink lipstick and that's when I'd melt  
She'd whisper in my ear tonight she really was mine  
Get back in front and put some hair oil on  
Buddy Holly was singing his very last song  
With your arms around your girl, you try to sing along  
It felt pretty good, woo!  
Really had a good time

They slam gun butts in his face

And music played at the penny arcade, yes it played and it played, played all

Your children are playing in that street again  
Don't you know what happened down there?  
A youth of fourteen got shot down there  
The Kokane guns of Jamdown Town  
The killing clowns, the blood money men  
Are shooting those Washington bullets again  
  
As every cell in Chile will tell  
The cries of the tortured men  
Remember Allende, and the days before,  
Before the army came  
Please remember Victor Jara,  
In the Santiago Stadium,  
Es verdad - those Washington Bullets again  
  
And in the Bay of Pigs in 1961,  
Havana fought the playboy in the Cuban sun,  
For Castro is a color,  
Is a redder than red,  
Those Washington bullets want Castro dead  
For Castro is the color...  
...That will earn you a spray of lead  
  
For the very first time ever,  
When they had a revolution in Nicaragua,  
There was no interference from America  
Human rights in America  
  
Well the people fought the leader,  
And up he flew...  
With no Washington bullets what else could he do?  
  
'N' if you can find a Afghan rebel  
That the Moscow bullets missed  
Ask him what he thinks of voting Communist...  
...Ask the Dalai Lama in the hills of Tibet,  
How many monks did the Chinese get?  
In a war-torn swamp stop any mercenary,  
'N' check the British bullets in his armory  
Que?  
Sandinista!

Like the blades of a 'copter  
Liftin' into the skies above some foreign land  
Soaked with the bodies of so many friends.  
  
Johnny waved  
He was on his way home  
He waved goodbye to his comrades in arms,  
And all the twisted things he'd seen.  
He waved goodbye  
And the blades hit  
Something  
Maybe just fate, but the blades hit  
The 'copter went up in flames  
And johnny never went marchin' home  
Johnny never went marchin' home  
  
They took his name  
And they carved it on a slab of marble  
With several thousand other names  
All the fallen idols  
The apples of their mother's eye  
Just another name  
  
Meanwhile  
Back on that burning shore  
Johnny's comrades stood speechless  
They looked with uh-uh-uh-uh disbelieving eyes  
As those bits of metal and the embers  
The embers of his eyes  
Fanned out into the air  
Black dust  
Flames  
  
Oh johnny! Some day they'll make a movie about you  
And in the making of that movie  
Some mad apocalypse  
It will become even stranger than the simple act  
Just a boy going up up up  
Just a boy going up  
In flames in the smoke  
Just another life  
Just another breath  
And who'll remember  
Oh eternity now  
As eternal as a sheet of marble  
Eternal as a slab on a green hill  
And your name  
And all your fallen brothers  
And all the ones not cut  
All the ones remembered only in the hearts  
A mother a father a brother a sister a lover a son a daughter  
Shall not shall not fade shall not fade  
  
Your ancestors salute you  
And the gods of your ancestors salute you  
Having having been formed by the minds of your ancestors  
The gods of your ancestors salute you  
Having been formed by your ancestors  
The gods of your ancestors salute you  
They draw you in they draw you through  
They draw they draw you through that golden door  
  
Mornin' boy [come on in boy]  
We remember you  
We conceived of you  
We conceived of your breath  
We conceived of the whole human race  
And we conceived it to be a beautiful thing  
Like a tulip bending in the wind  
Sometimes it comes back to us  
In the form of a handful of dust  
Comes back in the form of a smitten child  
Our raped daughters, ah the broken bones  
Souls cleaved from hearts  
They come back to us  
And our hands are filled with their rotting tissues  
But we turn not our backs  
We press our lips  
Into their cancer into the dust into the remains of each one  
And that love is there and will greet you, will greet you  
Mornin' boy [come on in boy]  
It's eternal love  
  
Well here, go ahead, run through that flame  
Awww man, running through your mind  
You took a cat, you took a life, you took it by the tail  
And you swirled it around your head  
And you thrashed it, you smashed the life out of it  
And you knew that it would be your own  
But you wanted to feel, you wanted to feel it die  
Because you know you would feel your own  
You would feel your own  
But you're remembered!  
You're remembered!  
You're remembered dead!  
You're remembered dead!

Like a King who stalks the wings and shoots the moon and the stars  
And his double  
It's more or less the same as the things that you said  
Anyway for all the things you know tell me why does the river not flow  
Anyway for all the things you said tell me why does the river run red  
Anyway for all the things you've seen tell me when will the river run green  
And anyway for all the things you know tell me why does the river not flow  
  
I see trouble up ahead  
Where the river boat swayed beneath the sun  
Is where the river runs red  
I see double, that's my trouble

Or are all y'all bored?  
It's good to have y'all back now  
Ladies and gents  
Y'all already know what it is  
God don't make no mistakes  
God don't make no mistakes  
  
Little do they know when I was brought up into this game  
Point ain't always in a vibe for spitting I made a change  
Like the diaper on the bottom of my baby daughter  
I wasn't ready to be no father, maybe, kind of, sorta  
'Cause when I saw her I swear it made a tear fall  
Not tears of sorrow but of joy so listen here y'all  
I grabbed the mic and moved the crowd then disappeared dog  
Back in '94 that was the motherfucking year homeboy  
Then that southernplayalistic went platinum  
Stacks on deck they ain't tell us to pay our taxes  
Walking around the table in the kitchen we was practicing  
Reciting rhymes to sharpen minds now lets deliver to the masses  
  
[Chorus]  
It's been a good long road  
Now its time for me to go  
I say goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye  
Time to spread my wings  
And high up in the sky  
I can fly, I'll fly, I'll fly, so high  
  
Welcome to my life I think its time I take it back  
I got to give you all the facts so you can see what type of cat  
That you dealing with now on ATLiens we was killing it  
And then my auntie pass she was like my mother I was feeling it  
The first person close to me to die I needed healing  
But I see her as an angel when I look up at the ceiling  
Like my daddy and grandaddy on both shoulders steady chilling  
So you got to keep on living like each day is the beginning  
It's yo birthday even on your worst day  
Live it like the first day I'm Antwan Andre  
Or General Patton if you know bout Purple Ribbon or Got Purp  
I, I be on that kryptonite that means I can't be hurt  
Gotta leave this place it's been cool but I gotta go  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Even on the train  
Should've asked two free mans  
I'll be back again  
(Know we been though a lot I ain't perfect but I swear  
To you I'm a changed man)  
Even on the train  
Should've asked two free mans  
I'll be back again  
(From the caboose)  
  
Now it's time to say goodbye they should've turned me loose  
I was all about my team but now I call upon my crew  
I'm a family type of person but I'm deadly dolo too  
And you can achieve anything that you put your heart into  
See the second hand will never stop and neither will the clock  
The nigga big still hit the stage by himself and still rock  
Cause when your faith is in the right place see he ain't gon let you flop  
You can say whatever you want (Bet you can't do it like me) Boy stop!!  
  
Before you can say you can't get going  
There's no excuse this time don't be afraid to fly  
You never know what day the doors will close  
It's time to say goodbye time to pack up and ride  
Got to leave this place it's been cool but I gotta go

That's musical doorbell

It plays America the beautiful and tie a yellow ribbon  
  
Boy, this punch is a trip  
It's o.k. in my book  
Here, take a sip  
Maybe little heaven on the fruit  
Ah, here comes the dip  
You may kiss the cook  
Let me show you honey  
It's easy, look  
You take a fork and spire 'em  
Say, did you try these ?

Don't talk to me about ozone layer

Let's hear it for the trees  
Ain't runnin' out of nothin' in my deep freeze

because I'm blessed with all the wonders of the sun  
when tigers, palmtrees, rattlesnakes unfold their graces  
that kind of magic you may get a sunburn from  
and there's no better way for us than our old sweet ways  
and angels burn to dust before the human race  
we're giants under a rainbow  
we're stranded east of eden  
Sometimes we're crying in the afterglow  
in a world of broken toys, how can we live without them  
freedom that is what you are always screaming  
it is a scream but more a nightmare than a laugh  
those without faith are liars even when they're dreaming  
I'd put my faith in god if he knew how to dance  
but there's no devil in the darkness, no demon in the skies  
nothing to be afraid of, cross my heart and hope to die  
freedom...  
Freedom...

And so I face the final curtain  
My friend, I'll say it clear  
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain  
I've lived a life that's full  
I traveled each and ev'ry highway  
And more, much more than this, I did it my way  
  
Regrets, I've had a few  
But then again, too few to mention  
I did what I had to do and saw it through without exemption  
I planned each charted course, each careful step along the byway  
And more, much more than this, I did it my way  
  
Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew  
When I bit off more than I could chew  
But through it all, when there was doubt  
I ate it up and spit it out  
I faced it all and I stood tall and did it my way  
  
I've loved, I've laughed and cried  
I've had my fill, my share of losing  
And now, as tears subside, I find it all so amusing  
To think I did all that  
And may I say, not in a shy way,  
""Oh, no, oh, no, not me, I did it my way""  
  
For what is a man, what has he got?  
If not himself, then he has naught  
To say the things he truly feels and not the words of one who kneels  
The record shows I took the blows and did it my way!

Yes, it was my way

Without courage or hope

And watching the smoke  
When out of the smoke appeared  
The sweetest surprise  
And I knew I'd been found  
When first I looked in  
To Anastasia's eyes.

My salvation lies  
It lies in the love that lives

I live upon morsels you happen to drop  
And coffee that somehow leaks out of your cup  
If nothing comes down then I'm forced to swim up  
On the way upwards, the colors come back  
But all along the bottom is blue, grey, and black  
The darkness is cold and perception goes wrong  
And the night seems to go on incredibly long  
  
So I ask you why if I'm swimming by,  
Don't you see anything you'd like to try?  
  
Pantomime mixtures of heaven and earth  
Jumbled events that have less than no worth  
Time in the forest to dig under rocks  
Or float in the ocean asleep in a box  
  
Or sink just below all the churning and froth  
And swim to the light source or fly like a moth  
So toss away stuff you don't need in the end  
But keep what's important and know who's your friend  
  
So I ask you why if I'm swimming by,

And guns are called to silence and anger called to still  
And brotherhood and sisterhood surrounded by goodwill

I've seen you give me looks that I've read about in books,  
And I finally had to make you play your hand.  
There's a reason that you're here, and I think it's perfectly clear.  
But it don't take much to make me understand.  
  
Come and dance with me, take me all the higher.  
Put your arms around me, make me feel much righter.  
Come and love with me, we can move real slow to the music.  
Come make love with me, come make love, make love with me.  
  
Oh ...

Oh Lordy how we could love  
Swore we'd be true to each other  
Just as true as stars above  
I was her man, she caught me doing her wrong  
  
My luck in poker was fading  
When a new gal caught my eye  
I gambled, I tried to change my luck  
With a chick named Nellie Bly  
I was Frankie's man but I was doing her wrong  
  
Yeah! Frankie came looking to find me  
Yes, she wasn't looking for fun  
For in her sweet loving hand  
She was totin' a 44 gun  
To shoot her man if he was doin' her wrong  
  
Well Frankie walked into the bar room  
And right there in front of her eyes  
There was her loving johnny  
Making love to that Nellie Bly  
I was her man, she caught me doing her wrong  
  
Frankie, I beg, please don't shoot me  
Well they'll put you away in a cell  
You know they'll put your where the cold wind blows  
From the hottest corner in hell  
I'm your man, I know I done you wrong  
  
Easy on the roll, real easy  
Easy on the roll, real slow  
Roll me over real gently  
'cause my wound hurts me so  
Well I was her man  
Well I done her wrong  
  
Well Frankie told johnny  
Well this is the end of my song  
I was her man, well I done her wrong  
Well , hey, hey, hey, hey, hey  
Done her wrong

With a stew so thick  
That I was afraid  
I might chew a brick  
Then I talked to you  
With my flapping tongue  
Choking on my words

Smudged with a bleeding pen

Abandoned words which is strange for me

Steal away, steal away  
  
Over the stones along the dusty old road  
With every footstep one more tale is told  
With every turning one more side to see  
Sweet Lady Mary's seen the last of me  
A lesson is learnt, I'll never come this way again  
I'll steal away, steal away  
  
Her Spanish habits are so hard to forget  
The lady lied with every breath, I accept  
Was a matter of time before my face did not fit  
I knew all along I'd have to quit.  
Anyway now, I better not waste anymore of your time  
I'll steal away, steal away  
  
I think I'll go back home and start all again  
Where the Gulf Stream waters tend to ease the pain  
And on a new day when I've mended the wound  
Sweet Lady Mary's gate I swear I'll be bound  
But before I sit down again and waste anymore of your time  
I better steal away, steal away

Multiplications on my digits, come up over some time  
3-57 in my spine, they can't hold me like Kobe Bryant  
Powered up, popping tulips and clovers and stop signs  
Taylor made, Gucci looking like a million bucks  
Neck full of gold baggets, and trillion cuts  
I reside on cuts, cause having money is a must  
Give me the issue or get touched, the scuffling up  
Fuck with the raw like a cut, cause I hit too hard  
Radio stations don't play, cause I spit too hard  
I know they hate me everyday, and I ain't quit so far  
But if you cross the line, AK is gone hit your car

Cause you know my name, it's Z-Ro the Crooked  
Z-Ro the Mo City Don, it ain't over it just begun

I'm the top knotch, body armored like Shaq done blocked shots  
Dropping cops cause they crooked, I'm the law now  
Posted on the corner, selling raw now  
Looking for them people, keep an open eye  
And if I see the jackers, never hesitate I gotta open fire  
Active like a live wire, retalliation is a must  
Rock and buy these bezzels, and then I bust  
Geniva watch, telling me it's time to ball  
Get in the line till I make it to the front, and then it's time to fall  
But if I ever fall off, just fall back behind the scene  
Take seven, catch me up in sitcoms and big screens  
[Hook]  
[Z-Ro]  
When I roll, I roll one deep  
I never stop wrecking, these H-Town streets  
And ain't nobody holding me down I'm a roll, I'm rolling  
If you didn't know Southside still holding, folding  
Big lemon faces, got real money cause I catch cases  
Sipping on skeet tastes, and I'ma lean in private or public places  
Milicated refreshness, keep my mind at ease  
Trying to reach another level, keep me climbing trees  
Coming smoke out my nose, bald faded minus before  
Keep it gangsta, got groupie hoes striking a pose  
But see they ain't getting chose, or catch me tipping my dob  
I need a independent thug chick, launder money and drug shit  
I'm the boss hog, ain't nobody hogging me over harder  
Soft then I'm off, in the funk in my roller

Let's go under my friend  
  
Are we sleeping  
Are we dreaming  
Are we dancing again  
Is it heaven  
Crack it open  
And we'll slide down  
Its stream  
  
We can hold on (I'm sure)  
To the sea's foaming mane  
It will serve us  
We'll surface  
And we'll plunge back again  
  
Sun is rising on the water  
Light is dancing like a flame  
There's no burning where the sun beams  
Oh it's such a lovely game  
  
Does the sea dream (I'm sure)  
We are here, we attend  
We are bells on the shore  
Where the tolling suspends  
  
Who will decide the shape of things  
The shift of being  
Who will perceive  
When life is new  
Shall we divide and become another  
Who is due for gift upon gift  
Who will decide  
Shall we swim over and over  
The curve of a wing  
Its destination ever changing  
  
Sun is rising on the water  
Light is dancing like a flame  
Let's go waltzing on the water  
Let's go under again  
  
Let's go under

A silhouette moves across a cinnamon sky  
Riding along on a horse he calls Music  
With a song on his lips, and a tear in his eye  
  
He dreams of a time, and a lady that loved him  
And how he would sing her sweet lullaby's  
But we don't ever ask him, and he never talks about her  
I guess its just better that we all let it slide  
  
[Chorus]  
And he sings ooh to the ladies  
And ooh he makes 'em sigh  
Then he rides away on a horse he calls Music  
With a pain in his heart, and a tear in his eye  
  
Now he rode the Music from Boston to Bozman  
For not too much money, and way too much ride  
But those were the days when a horse he called Music  
Could jump through the moon and scale across the sky  
  
Now all that's left is an old time worn cowboy  
With only his dreams of the days long gone by  
And trailin' behind is a horse with no rider  
A horse he calls Memories that she used to ride

High on a mountain in western Montana  
Two crossed cut through a cinnamon sky  
Marking the place where a horse he called Music  
Lays with a cowboy in the sweet by and by

Don't look away, oh no  
  
Well, i follow her down to some part of town  
Where we've never been before  
There's a car in the drive, and a man sits inside  
I gotta stop her, before she gets in  
  
She's a woman, playing a woman's game  
When i ask her  
She looks at me like i'm insane  
  
I say, don't look away, babe  
When i'm talking to you  
Don't look away, babe  
It'll do you no good  
I'm into your game, babe  
I been listening to you  
Don't look away babe  
Don't look away, oh no

14770,Oingo Boingo,Good For Your Soul,/o/oingo+boingo/good+for+your+soul_20102796.html,"Have you ever felt that somehow  
You were not yourself  
That your body was the same  
But everything around you wasn't right  
And images so strange and foreign  
Flooded in like raging water  
  
Have you ever been in love  
With someone you hardly knew  
Whereas every time you closed your eyes,  
You saw this person come alive  
It kept you wide awake at night  
You felt like you were burning up  
In pain, you want to scream  
Then you passed out in a dream  
  
Chorus  
Just once or twice is good for your soul  
Just once or twice is good for your soul  
If you don't stop, you'll lose control  
Just once or twice is good for your soul  
  
Every lay there half asleep all hours of the night  
With some nagging demon tugging at that tiny bell  
Inside your mind  
When suddenly that strange idea  
Bursts into an inspiration  
You grab for it and then  
The whole thing slips right through your fingers  
  
Chorus  
  
Just once or twice is good for your soul  
Just once or twice is good for your soul  
Just once or twice is good for your soul  
Just once or twice is good for your soul

It's good for your soul

Ain't quite so bad.  
  
Ten years old with thoughts as bold as thoughts can be.  
Loving life and becoming wise  
In simplicity.  
  
Sickness will surely take the mind  
Where minds can't usually go.  
Come on the amazing journey  
And learn all you should know.  
  
A vague haze of delirium  
Creeps up on me.  
All at once a tall stranger I suddenly see.  
He's dressed in a silver sparkled  
Glittering gown  
And his golden beard flows  
Nearly down to the ground.  
  
Nothing to say and nothing to hear  
And nothing to see.  
Each sensation makes a note  
In my symphony.  
  
Sickness will surely take the mind  
Where minds can't usually go.  
Come on the amazing journey  
And learn all you should know.  
  
His eyes are the eyes that  
Transmit all they know.  
Sparkle warm crystalline glances to show  
That he is your leader  
And he is your guide  
On the amazing journey  
Together you'll ride.

That someone should listen for  
  
[Chorus]  
Nothing should matter  
Not when love grows inside you  
The choice is yours  
There's a miracle in store  
Nothing should matter  
Not when love grows inside you  
A voice of love is crying out  
Don't throw love away  
There's a miracle in store  
  
How could I let go of a miracle  
Nothing could ever take its place  
Thought I was looking  
Out for myself  
Now it seems the pain  
Is all that I have gained  
I wonder if I could be your miracle  
I wonder if I could spare you pain  
Seems as though nothing will comfort me  
Less today I pray  
That you should come listen  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Don't ever throw away your miracle  
Don't let it slip away  
Nothing should matter  
  
[Chorus]

'Cause on my love you can depend  
  
I see your face before me, as I lay on my bed  
I kinda get to thinking of all the things we said  
You gave a promise to me, and I gave mine to you  
I need someone beside me in everything I do  
  
You know I love you I always will

And drank a potion, baby to erase you  
Face down in the boulevard yet I couldn't face you

It doesn't change anything, so baby what good does it do?  
Your friends they'll sympathize, maybe I don't need them to

Instead I'm the lonely one

There's nowhere to run away  
Said, 'Boy if you want love, you'll have to go and find it with someone new'  
'Do you know who you really are? Are you sure it's really you'?  
Lies are a funny thing  
They slip through your fingertips because they never happened to you  
Time wounds all the heals as we fade out of view  
  
Imagine I'd be your one and only  
Instead I'm the lonely one

Silence is closer  
We're passing ships in the night  
Into the light, left with nowhere to hide  
  
Closer and closer  
We're crashing ships in the night

Wondering what to do  
With a lump of wood, a piece of wire  
And a little pot of glue  
O Mamma O Mamma  
  
He sawed at the wood with half a heart  
And glued it top to bottom  
He strung a wire in between  
He was feeling something rotten  
O Mamma O Mamma  
  
Orpheus looked at his instrument  
And he gave the wire a pluck  
He heard a sound so beautiful  
He gasped and said O my God  
O Mamma O Mamma  
  
He rushed inside to tell his wife  
He went racing down the halls  
Eurydice was still asleep in bed  
Like a sack of cannonballs  
O Mamma O Mamma  
  
Look what I've made, cried Orpheus  
And he plucked a gentle note  
Eurydice's eyes popped from their sockets  
And her tongue burst through her throat  
O Mamma O Mamma  
  
O God, what have I done, he said  
As her blood pooled in the sheets  
But in his heart he felt a bliss  
With which nothing could compete  
O Mamma O Mamma  
  
Orpheus went leaping through the fields  
Strumming as hard as he did please  
Birdies detonated in the sky  
Bunnies dashed their brains out on the trees  
O Mamma O Mamma  
  
Orpheus strummed till his fingers bled  
He hit a G minor 7  
He woke up God from a deep, deep sleep  
God was a major player in heaven  
O Mamma O Mamma  
  
God picked up a giant hammer  
And He threw it with an thunderous yell  
It smashed down hard on Orpheus' head  
And knocked him down a well  
O Mamma O Mamma  
  
The well went down very deep  
Very deep went down the well  
The well went down so very deep  
Well, the well went down to hell  
O Mamma O Mamma  
  
Poor Orpheus woke up with a start  
All amongst the rotting dead  
His lyre tacked safe under his arm  
His brains all down his head  
O Mamma O Mamma  
  
Eurydice appeared brindled in blood  
And she said to Orpheus  
If you play that fucking thing down here  
I'll stick it up your orifice!  
O Mamma O Mamma  
  
This lyre lark is for the birds, said Orpheus  
It's enough to send you bats  
Let's stay down here, Eurydice, dear  
And we'll have a bunch of screaming brats  
O Mamma O Mamma  
  
Orpheus picked up his lyre for the last time  
He was on a real low down bummer  
And stared deep into the abyss and said  
This one is for Mamma

Sit at my desk while the clock counts up my wages  
  
Pick up my pay every Friday and take off like a  
Shot in the dark  
I took off like a shot in the dark  
I split the scene like a shot in the dark  
  
Ain't got no target, don't aim for no mark  
'Cause I'm off like a shot in the dark  
It was only a game when we first started  
The novelty wore away and the fun departed  
  
I can't live up anymore to those things I spouted  
And if you say you feel the same way  
I'll be off like a  
Shot in the dark  
  
There's no changes going down  
There's no lesson to be found  
Makes no sense to hang around  
If that's all there is to that  
  
(That's what she said)  
Someone just tossed a bomb through  
Kitchen window  
And in the middle of a shoo-fly pie

'cause your thoughts and words won't last forever more  
But I'm not sure if it ever works out right  
But it's ok. It's all right  
  
When yer lonely and you start to hear  
The little voices in your head at night  
You will only sniff away the tears  
So you can dance until the morning light  
At what price?

Just rolls out, fifteen hundred cities every one of em' sold out

Just yesterday.  
Life was such a simple game,  
A child could play.  
It was easy then to tell right from wrong.  
Easy then to tell weak from strong.  
When a man should stand and fight,  
Or just go along.  
  
But today there is no day or night  
Today there is no dark or light.  
Today there is no black or white,  
Only shades of gray.  
  
I remember when the answers seemed so clear  
We had never lived with doubt or tasted fear.  
It was easy then to tell truth from lies  
Selling out from compromise  
Who to love and who to hate,  
The foolish from the wise.  
  
But today there is no day or night  
Today there is no dark or light.  
Today there is no black or white,  
Only shades of gray.  
  
It was easy then to know what was fair  
When to keep and when to share.  
How much to protect your heart  
And how much to care.  
  
But today there is no day or night  
Today there is no dark or light.  
Today there is no black or white,  
Only shades of gray.  
Only shades of gray.

I'm the Gypsy - The acid queen.  
I'll tear your soul apart.  
  
Give us a room and close the door  
Leave us for a while.  
Your boy won't be a boy no more  
Young, but not a child.  
I'm the Gypsy - the acid queen.  
Pay before we start.  
I'm the Gypsy the acid queen.  
I'll tear your soul apart.  
  
Gather your wits and hold on fast,  
Your mind must learn to roam.  
Just as the Gypsy Queen must do  
You're gonna hit the road.  
  
My work is done now look at him  
He's never been more alive.  
His head it shakes his fingers clutch.  
Watch his body writhe  
I'm the Gypsy - the acid queen.  
Pay before we start.  
I'm the Gypsy - I'm guaranteed.  
To break your little heart.

They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe  
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my open mind,  
Possessing and caressing me.

Nothing's gonna change my world,  
Nothing's gonna change my world.  
  
Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes,  
That call me on and on across the universe,  
Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box they  
Tumble blindly as they make their way  
Across the universe  
Jai guru de va om  
Nothing's gonna change my world,  
Nothing's gonna change my world.  
  
Sounds of laughter shades of love are ringing  
Through my open ears [views] inciting and inviting me  
Limitless undying love which shines around me like a  
Million suns, it calls me on and on  
Across the universe

Falsehood and mortality which bar him  
The way back into the higher world  
While his whole being is bewildered  
He does not know no law of action  
Taking refuge inside himself and he's saying  
  
I need someone to show me  
Illumine my consciousness  
Remove the dark from in me  
And give me that which I have lost  
  
As all had seemed lost a light from Heaven  
Breaking  
A flash inward illumination  
Enriched his life more than any words can tell  
He stood there, life renewed fresh as rain  
Scales were falling from his eyes again  
The bolts of his prison opening he's saying  
  
I found someone who showed me  
Illumined my consciousness  
Removed the dark from in me  
And given me that which I have lost  
  
You people don't have time to listen to him  
You're too busy fighting revolutions  
That keep you back down in the lower world  
Your mirrors of understanding they need  
Cleansing  
Polish away the dust of desire  
Before pure light will reflect in them  
  
You need someone to show you  
Illumine your consciousness  
Remove the dark from in you  
And give you that which you have lost.

English translation:  
Though I've lived  
All this time  
All by myself  
Unconcerned with destiny  
I was awoken by  
A flash of light,  
In the middle of the night  
I quietly stand at the exit  
Shooting light at the darkness  
Nowadays I wonder if making promises  
Will only make things worse.  
I just want to tell someone my wish.  
I'll introduce you to my family  
I'm sure you'll go over well.  
No matter what happens  
We're always together  
No matter what happens  
We're by each other's side  
A light named you finds me  
In the middle of the night.  
Go out into a noisy street (When you turn my way)  
Take off the mask of destiny. (Take it all away)  
Stop doing meaningless things  
Like always trying to predict what's gonna happen next.  
Let's eat tasty food today.  
The future is still way off.  
Even I don't know what will happen  
Don't complete it  
Make it better,  
We'll be okay if we take it  
One scene at a time.  
A light named you reflects my scenario,  
On the screen.  
Let's talk some more,  
About the tomorrow which is just around the bend.  
Turn off the TV  
An look only at me.  
No matter how good it seems  
I can't truly believe  
At those times  
We're with each other.  
A light called you finds me  
In the middle of the night.  
Let's talk some more,  
About the tomorrow which is just around the bend.  
Turn off the TV  
And look only at me.  
Let's talk some more,  
About the tomorrow which is just around the bend.

Took us by the hands and up we go  
  
We followed the dreamer through the purple hazy clouds  
He could control our sense of time  
We thought we were lost but no matter how we tried  
Everyone was in peace of mind  
  
We felt the sensations drift inside our frames  
Finding complete contentment there  
And all the tensions that hurt us in the past  
Just seemed to vanish in thin air  
  
He said in the cosmos is a single sonic sound  
That is vibrating constantly  
And if we could grip and hold on to the note  
We would see our minds were free...oh they're free  
  
We are lost above  
Floating way up high

You can surely try

No rock 'n roll, no Christianity

No struggle town, no bemused Trudeau  
No solitary walks through vacant lots in moon glow  
Tonight the winter may have missed its mark  
You can see your breath in Springside Park  
Coffee-colored ice and peeling birch bark  
The sound of rushing water in the dark

Don't barter with me

And bodies thrown everywhere  
I'll wrap 'em up and carry 'em  
If someone has to bury them

When it's time for me to labor for you  
Everybody move it  
Like a mother

'Bout something that can make me smile.  
Gonna have be content,  
To stare at your baby photos 'til it makes some sense,  
And were you ever mine anyway?  
  
Speak up as I drop away.  
I wrote down what I think on the head of a matchstick,  
Wrote it all short and sweet, all that made sense to me,  
Burnt six thousand minds, sorry for all times,  
  
I just can't add up the sums to find the damage we've done.  
I fell for you like a dog from a tree,  
Keep a straight stitched face,  
As the ground makes a bed for me,  
  
I keep my eye where I fell, sends no replies.  
You can run so long from sadness,  
That you're never at home for the fun,  
I can't make excuses,  
  
For the short hand abuses,  
Thank God it ain't a Sunday night.

i stand on painted tape  
It tells me where I'm going  
And where to throw my cape  
I call my co-stars brother  
I call my co-stars name  
I play both good and evil parts  
I sing to Verdi's grave  
  
And every single morning  
By 10 a.m I'm dressed  
My rehearsals last for hours and hours  
With diligence I have been blessed  
Some people, they call me monster  
Some people, they call me saint  
My talent feeds my darker side  
Yet no-one will complain  
  
I am an opera singer  
I sing in foreign lands  
I've sung for Kings in Europe  
And Emperors in Japan  
  
And after each performance  
People stand around and wait  
Just to tell me that they loved my voice  
Just to tell me that I'm great  
I am an opera singer  
I will sing when you're all dead  
I sing the mountains crumbling apart  
I sing what can't be said  
  
I am an opera singer  
I sing in foreign lands  
Most people seem to know my name  
Or at least know who I am

Sprinkled with horses  
Wild in resistance to the taming  
Will you break me

Stay awake and keep it roar  
Go all night and got before, you're beautiful  
  
I'm gonna take you on a drive around Central Park  
Buy you some real good french wine  
I'll treat you like a queen, you got a spell on me  
It's a voodoo kind of thing  
  
It's evil, when something's so bad makes you feel this good  
It's evil, alright, it's in my blood and it feels like it should  
  
She's so evil, way she walks into the room  
And I may not leave here alive  
And the evil, and the evil, and the evil, and the evil  
  
Don't you know it's evil  
When something's so bad makes you feel this good  
It's evil, alright  
It's in my blood and it feels like it should

One chance  
For a true love  
If a heart breaks,  
Does it break forever?  
There'll be no more,  
Though you want back together  
  
You soon will start running baby,  
I know you will.  
Though I've seen it coming lately,  
I love you still.  
How long must I keep on trying  
To change your mind?  
How long till there's no denying  
We're out of time?  
  
Is there really just,  
One chance  
At a true love  
If a heart breaks,  
Does it break forever?  
There'll be no more,  
Though you want back together.  
  
Is there really just,  
One chance  
At a new start  
But just one glance  
Tells you it doesn't matter  
So you turn 'round so you  
Don't have to face it.  
  
Where are you goin' baby?  
Where have you been?  
I don't even know you lately,  
Let me back in.  
I guess I'll just keep on waiting,  
It's all I can do.  
Feels like the future's fadin' into the blue.

In the same place  
For maybe just a little too long

Couldn't wait to build a cocoon (original lyrics)  
Couldn't wait to buy blue suede shoes (recent lyrics)  
Spent all his days eatin' leaves in the shade  
And stayed when the night set, too.  
Conrad the Caterpillar knew life would be a thriller  
Soon as the threads was spun  
Wouldn't stop to play in the Caterpillar Games  
Till his own webbing game was done.  
  
He said, ""No, no, I got no time to play,  
Got a thousand little legs that don't get me too far in a day,  
I'm leaving, looks like I can't stay.""  
  
That little pillar he found him a willow  
Spun in with a craftsmans weave  
Wound so tightly to protect him from the light  
And all shapes of water that drop from the leaves  
Conrad the Caterpillar knew he would be a chiller  
And he wound it tighter some more  
Wound it so wide and the ends of his legs got sore.  
  
He said, ""No, now I can't feel my feet  
Just when I thought it was time to take a stroll on down the street  
I'm leaving, looks like I can't leave  
What do you know?  
What's all this moving around with inside me?  
  
What kind of 'piller could touch the world of a miller  
Chopping trees to build a new store  
Nobody sees a lonely bump on the tree  
Except a lump who's crying for more  
Conrad the Caterpillar knew life would be a chiller as he wound it tighter
some more  
Anybody stands in the caterpillar's place is moving in a standing run  
  
He said, ""No brother, I just need some room to fly,  
I spent all of my days just trying to keep dry  
Oh I'd take a waterfall or a drop from my eye  
I can't see nothin' from here anyway, I might as well make room and try  
Might as well try  
  
Oh no, I just need a little room to play  
Got a thousand little wings and I'm gonna use them all today  
I'm leaving, it looks like I gotta stay.

But they never seem to close  
The fan blades on the ceiling spin

And even though you're next to me  
I still feel so alone  
I just can't give you anything  
For you to call your own  
  
And I can feel you breathing  
And it's keeping me awake  
Can you feel it beating?  
My heart sinking like a wave  
  
Something I've been keeping locked away  
Behind my lips  
I can feel it breaking free  
With each and every kiss  
I couldn't bear to hurt you  
But it's all so different now  
Things that I was sure of then  
Now filled me up with doubt  
  
And I can feel you breathing  
And it's keeping me awake

How am I suppose to feel about the things I've done  
I don't know if I should stay or turn around and run  
I know that I hurt you  
Things will never be the same  
The only love I ever knew I threw it all away

Bosses broke south for new flesh and a factory floor  
The remains left chained to the powder war

Make mountains move, crumble at your feet to get you through  
Another day, another night alone  
Step right out into the great unknown tonight  
Even God knows, baby, that ain't right  
Why don't you run away and find yourself alive  
Go on and turn the page before your lonely world collides

That's been tearin' you apart? If God could talk  
Did you swear to yourself on the day it was over  
That you'd never turn around and get locked up in another cage?  
Did you tear all the pictures of us living life together  
Did you burn all the memories that have been made in a fit of rage?

Might have liked and understood  
  
He goes to work each morning  
And he comes home every night  
And the time that passes in between  
He knows has been spent right  
  
A child in South Ohio  
A man in Northern Maine  
He took his dream to the end of the world  
And he brought it back again  
  
Here he met his sweet Rebekah  
Here he came to make his stand  
In a house he built in the piny woods  
Where the ocean meets the land  
  
And it's hey ho, steady as you go  
Sing for the love of the land  
Hey ho, blessed is the home  
Born of the carpenter's hand  
  
Oh, his hair is rough and curly  
And his legs they reach the ground  
And his eyes are full of living  
And his back is broad and brown  
  
And his heart is sure and stubborn  
And his pride's too strong to bend  
And somewhere in his life  
He found the time to be my friend  
  
And it's hey ho, steady as you go  
Sing for the love of the land  
Hey ho, blessed is the home  
Born of the carpenter's hand  
  
Oh, he loves his sweet Rebekah  
He'll love her 'til his death  
And she gave to him a bonny son  
And they named the child Seth  
  
And now they are a family  
A community of three  
Living in the piny woods  
Where the soil meets the sea  
  
And it's hey ho, steady as you go  
Sing for the love of the land  
Hey ho, blessed is the home  
Born of the carpenter's hand

Through the tall grass growing in the old bayou  
The old bayou  
  
There's a dark haired woman that looks so fine  
Wearing hand me down clothes, drinking homemade wine  
No one ever knew who her daddy was  
The people down here say it's all because  
She's the daughter of the devil, the sister of a snake  
The keeper of souls down on Voodoo Lake  
  
There's a city boy across the county line  
Came looking for the legend of the girl so fine  
Well the stories that he heard, well they had to be lies  
But he found out different when he looked in her eyes  
Well he tried to run away but she had control  
He's findin' out now what everybody knows  
He knew it was over when she started to shake  
Now there's one more soul down on Voodoo Lake  
  
There's an eerie silence at the break of dawn  
A chill in the air, something wrong  
When a shadow crosses the ground  
Those long lost souls never make a sound  
You'd think by now they'd realize  
She'll never break her bayou ties  
  
She's the daughter of the devil, the sister of a snake  
The keeper of souls down on Voodoo Lake  
  
Voodoo Lake, Voodoo Lake  
Daughter of the devil, sister of a snake  
Voodoo Lake  
Down on Voodoo Lake, down on Voodoo Lake  
You can see her down on Voodoo Lake

Its the cities known rap spitta  
Semi blown clack niggas  
Skin and bones but really known as that nigga  
I'm known to chase the bucks  
Grind to get my paper up  
In the studio writin' rhymes til the paper crunch  
I'm not the type that you would call em a thug  
But I'm a hustler its all in my blood  
So if its all for the cheese then I'm in it  
My screws kinda loose so I ease to the finish  
I hop up in the coupe feel the breeze while I'm in it  
Blowin' smoke up out the roof from the trees that I'm spliffin'  
Youngin' got the game on lock  
I'm on top its a shame y'all not  
You a lame put your brain on pot  
Leave you wet like the rain y'all drop

Realist shit and your main wife dig me

Niggas wanna play games I quickly  
Mob with a squad that will bang y'all wit' me  
And they want the kid still hurtin'  
Hundred niggas wit hammers  
Yea that's wat I call a steal curtain  
I handle my time and still work it  
Put in work couple mil. worth in  
And I'm from Pittsburgh where the green  
And the eatin' is good  
Where the fiends do everything in the hood  
Everyday is like a war so my soldiers ride fatiguesin the hood  
And we gettin' all the green like we should  
You know yea

Guess what---I'm stirring it with a monkey's paw  
Since I saw you coming out of my barber's shop  
In that skimpy little halter top  
  
Did you light the candles? Did you put on ""Kind of Blue""?  
Did you use that Ivy Leaage voodoo on him, too?  
He thinks he'll be alright but he doesn't know for sure  
Like every other unindicted coconspirator  
  
Mata Hari had a house in France  
Where she worked on all her secret plans  
Men were falling for her sight unseen  
She was a genius  
  
There's a face in every window of the Songwriter's Neighborhood  
Everybody's your best friend whey you're doing well--I mean good  
The poet who lived next door when you were young and poor  
Grew up to be a backstabbing entrepreneur  
  
Albert Einstein was a ladies' man  
While he was working on his universal plan  
He was making out like Charlie Sheen  
He was a genius  
  
When you dropped me and you staked your claim  
On a V.I.P. who could make your name  
You latched on to him and I became  
A minor inconvenience  
  
Your protege don't care about art  
I'm the one who always told you you were smart  
You broke my heart into smithereens  
And that took genius  
  
You and the barber make a handsome pair  
Guess what---I never liked the way he cut your hair  
I didn't like the way he turned your head  
But there's nothing I can do or say I haven't done or said  
  
Everybody needs a place to stand  
And a method for their schemes and scams  
If I could only get my record clean  
I'd be a genius

When lonely men would wander  
Through this land  
Rolling aimlessly along  
So many times  
I've heard of their sad story  
Written in the words  
Of dead men's songs.  
Down through the years  
Many men have yearned  
For freedom  
Some found it  
Only on the open road  
So many tears of blood  
Have fell around us  
'cause you can't always do what you are told.  
Please tell me where  
Have all the hobos gone to  
I see no fire burning down  
By the rusty railroad track  
Could it be that time  
Has gone and left them  
Tied up in life's eternal traveling sack.  
Last Sunday night  
I wrote a letter  
To my loved one  
I signed my name  
And knew I'd stayed away  
Too long  
There was a time  
When my heart was free to wander  
And I remember as I sing  
This hobo song.

Before the thing could answer me well someone came and took the lamp away  
I looked around, a lousy candle was all I found.

[Violent J]  
She was lovely, long hair, short, nice figure though  
So at the funeral, it made me cry, watch her die  
I cannot lie, I couldn't sleep without a wink  
I only think about my lady, I want my baby  
I need her by my side, to hold me, to squeeze me  
  
I still have pictures, but all they do is tease me  
I see my therapist, he only tells me I'm in trouble  
I want my baby back, so now I pack a shovel  
And while I'm digging, it's awfully dark and kinda funny  
Don't dig too fast or to see things could get bloody  
I watch my baby, I hit the top of baby's coffin  
I thinking, she's better off inside if she died  
Yeah, she needs me, I can tell my baby wants me  
'cause every night at 2:15, my baby haunts me  
I prey it open, the odor hits me, there she is  
I lean down to give her a kiss because I need a...

Ya know what I'm saying  
I want me a cold stanky bitch

She's as lovely as always, my baby hasn't changed  
Except for the hole that's in her forehead, you can see her brains  
Nevertheless, our love is still forever true  
Her eyes have withered, her skin has now a tint of blue  
My baby's dusty and dirty, and wrinkled clothes  
And now I notice, the maggots chewed off all her toes  
The earth has been rather cruel to my darling sugar  
Is that a bug upon her face? oh, it's just a booger  
I lean her head back to kiss her cracking lips  
And then her neck crack, also does her hips  
I must be gentle, my baby girl's a little rusty  
A little dusty, but most of all, a little musty  
I notice that, when we lay together on the lawn  
We lay till dawn, I notice her left eye is gone  
We said goodbye and everything turned out alright  
I'll see you again tomorrow night, because I need a...

Betty the waitress and some clothes in the back  
A dashboard full of roadmaps of Mexico

Is the blue moonlight

Uh  
  
This is me.  
Still the same.  
They want the hits.  
I play the game.  
No auto tune, but you can feel the pain.  
It all comes spilling out like I hit a vein.  
What up lil' braw.  
What up slumville.  
I hope you know that y'all the reason I have fun still.  
The fans thinking that we all signed for one mill.  
Equal opportunities rapping, that shit is unreal.  
That ain't how it works.  
That ain't that how it goes.  
And I been getting high to balance out the lows.  
And I could use a writer to balance my flows.  
But I never share my thoughts,  
This is all a nigga knows.  
And every time I try, it opens up my eyes.  
These verses are a chance to remembered and reprized.  
And I would be performing just as long as I'm alive.  
So every word I utter will be mine.  
  
Don't believe the lies.

So please don't be scared of me.  
Please don't be scared of me.  
  
Don't take this the wrong way but  
I never cried when Pac died.  
But I probably will when Hov does.  
And if my tears hold value,  
Then I would drop one for every single thing he showed us.  
And I'll be standing in a puddle.  
I stay away from niggas that could land me in some trouble.  
And Ima keep it honest.  
Am so tired of being subtle.  
It's just me, Forty, O, and Nich standing in a huddle.  
Staring at the members of my team.  
Who get questioned about they profit from this from million dollar scheme.  
Just know that am in debt for you defending all our dreams.  
I hope you tell your family this shit ain't what it seems.  
But yall the reason for a lot of my devotion.  
You know I spend money because spending time is hopeless.  
And know I pop bottles cause I bottle my emotions.  
At least I put it all in the open.  
  
Don't believe the lies.  
Look me in my eyes.  
Please don't be scared of me.  
Please don't be scared of me.  
I remember you.

Fuck all y'all.  
We ignore feelings here.  
Premature millionaires.  
Welcome to my realest year.  
Yeah.  
I swear we making a killer here.  
I should be on top of the world here just chillin' here.  
Uh.  
But it's funny having fans.  
Who find you before anybody ever has the chance,  
And build you up so you could be the biggest in the game.  
And realize when your there, sometimes the shit don't feel the same.  
Yeah.  
And plus things are just so real at home  
People think I've changed just because my appeal's grown  
And now security follow me everywhere  
So I'm never actually am alone, I just always feel alone.  
I think I'm scared of what the future holds.  
I was wishing for some things and now am used to those.  
Every girl I meet thinks I'm fucking groupie hoes.  
The honesty of my music has left me too exposed.  
All my old friends think I got a new crowd.  
And people seem to notice every time I do smile.  
I guess that mean they come few and far between.  
Even though am living out what you would call the dream.  
Yeah.  
And my uncle ain't even messaging me.  
And him missing in my life is kind of messing with me.  
I hope this isn't one of those forever things.  
It's funny how money can change everything.  
  
Don't believe the lies.  
Look me in my eyes.  
Please don't be scared of me.  
Please don't be scared of me.

And let your standard feelings  
Dissolve away with time  
Allow the clouds to shift  
And your heart to blossom  
Every things gonna be just fine  
Won't you stand up  
And let your standard feelings  
Dissolve away with time  
For your time hear now  
Is the time you wanted  
Let the good things dance inside  
Your head  
To want it and need it  
When taken by  
Complete surprise

And says, ""Hey, you""

Like Halloween day but it was Fourth of July now  
A car crash with a suitcase and a painted face  
She was one of a kind  
She wears a plastic crown like Cinderella  
And roller skates in bed  
  
Crash rides the greyhound from his hometown  
When he comes around 'cause they don't let him drive now  
Mixed up as a milkshake  
But make no mistake  
They're shooting for the stars  
  
[Chorus:]  
You and me  
We're invincible together  
We can be so tragical, whatever  
Dressed up just like ziggy but he couldn't play guitar  
Captain Crash and the beauty queen from mars  
  
Share a toothpick, trading lipstick  
Watching traffic for days at the diner  
Holding hands, making big plans  
Playing Superman, he was wearing eyeliner  
Another local legend and his longtime lucky charm  
  
[Chorus:]  
You and me  
We're invincible together  
We can be so tragical, whatever  
Dressed up just like ziggy but he couldn't play guitar

They're drunk on love as you can get  
Getting high on lust and cigarettes  
Living life with no regrets  
At least they're gonna try to fly

Making my desicions  
Sometimes they aren't so great  
I seeem to make it through these  
But times are gettin' harder and harder

They know the road and the ways of life  
And can help you make it through the day  
  
After a while you'll get used to the road  
And the way that is going to be  
I promise you'll get used to it...  
You'll just have to see  
  
Cause Life's Like a road  
And it must go on  
And it seems like it goes on forever and ever...

And we'd talk with our eyes  
Of the sweetness in our lives  
And tomorrows of rich surprise...  
Some things we could do  
  
In our madness  
We burnt one hundred days,  
Time takes time to pass  
And I still hold some ashes to me,  
An Occasional Dream.  
  
And we'd sleep, oh so close,

'Tween the sheets of summer bathed in blue...  
Gently weeping nights  
It was long, long ago  
And I can't touch your name.  
For the days of fater were strong for you...  
Danced you far from me.  
  
In my madness  
I see your face in mine.  
I keep a photograph  
It burns my wall with time  
Time,  
An occasional dream  
Of mine.  
An occasional dream  
Of mine.  
An occasional dream

Well its so hard  
To give what you've got  
  
After the love goes  
Here I go  
There's no easy road

13082,Michael W. Smith,Pursuit Of The Dream,/m/michael+w+smith/pursuit+of+the+dream_20093045.html,"Wake up and dream about  
The plans you have in store for you  
But keep in mind  
It's not just what you do  
But what you do it for-and who  
There are roads to discover  
There are stories yet to be told  
As you see the big picture  
Just beginning to unfold (so)  
  
[Chorus:]  
Break down the barriers but  
Don't bend the rules  
Never forget your roots  
As you head for something new  
Ride through the shades of desire  
Letting the light be seen  
And he'll steer the heart in the  
Pursuit of the dream  
  
It's alright to find yourself  
Thinking now and then  
About the way you want your life to be  
Anticipating what lies  
Just around the bend  
Can't wait to see  
  
Comes the time of decision  
Some you dodge and some you should face  
As you see the big picture  
There will be some dues to pay (so)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Wake up and dream about  
The plans you have in store for you  
But keep in mind  
It's not just what you do  
But what you do it for-and who  
  
There are choices that build you  
Choices that will make you fall  
All part of the big picture  
One day you will see it all

Still going past me in the street,  
Past me in the street,  
Past me in the street.

11483,Leonard Cohen,The Traitor,/l/leonard+cohen/the+traitor_20082845.html,"Now the Swan it floated on the English river  
Ah the Rose of High Romance it opened wide  
A sun tanned woman yearned me through the summer  
And the judges watched us from the other side  
  
I told my mother ""Mother I must leave you  
Preserve my room but do not shed a tear  
Should rumour of a shabby ending reach you  
It was half my fault and half the atmosphere""  
  
But the Rose I sickened with a scarlet fever  
And the Swan I tempted with a sense of shame  
She said at last I was her finest lover  
And if she withered I would be to blame  
  
The judges said you missed it by a fraction  
Rise up and brace your troops for the attack  
Ah the dreamers ride against the men of action  
Oh see the men of action falling back  
  
But I lingered on her thighs a fatal moment  
I kissed her lips as though I thirsted still  
My falsity had stung me like a hornet  
The poison sank and it paralyzed my will  
  
I could not move to warn all the younger soldiers  
That they had been deserted from above  
So on battlefields from here to Barcelona  
I'm listed with the enemies of love  
  
And long ago she said ""I must be leaving,  
Ah but keep my body here to lie upon  
You can move it up and down and when I'm sleeping  
Run some wire through that Rose and wind the Swan""  
  
So daily I renew my idle duty  
I touch her here and there, I know my place  
I kiss her open mouth and I praise her beauty  
And people call me traitor to my face

There's the sky, where the sea should be

Don't you want me to stay  
Verse  
You can take the fire away  
But the flame burns hotter  
You can take the love away  
But the memory's stronger every day  
Can't stop it, can't help it  
I'll never forget about you

See you give 'em your nickels, your pennies and dimes  
But you can't give 'em hope in these mercenary times, oh no  
And you feel real guilty about the coat on your back  
And the sandwich you had, oh no

When you get to the corner don't look at those freaks  
Keep your head down low and stay quick on your feet, oh yeah

The ones who died  
The ones who tried  
The ones that sit and gloat

Frozen lives for whom nothing's happening  
Hungry children is a mother's dilemma  
Dumpster diving to feed her baby emma  
So you walk on by like it doesn't affect you  
The held out hand that you pay no respect to  
Nickels and dimes won't even buy your guilt  
Another wino burnt to death in his quilt  
It's a cardboard city, newspaper metropolis  
The system can't cope or keep on top of this  
The authorities come as you're not for display  
Do they solve the problem no they move him away  
They're in a vicious circle of no fixed abode  
The social won't pay 'em the money they're owed  
When you've got no money you can't pay rent  
Hypothermia kills ''cause the system is bent

In the subway sits a vacuous man  
His grip on life is a bent tin can  
It's a holy shrine where he burns his light  
It makes things easy and removes his plight  
For an hour or two but he can't escape  
They're all penned in with government tape  
There are good samaritans who bring the soup  
The sally army with their bibles and boots  
You can see yourself as it's not too far  
One short trip you don't who they are  
Till the night comes then it all comes back  
Like the smell of patchouli and the armies of rats  
It's a shame to be human it's a human shame  
It seems we've forgotten we're one and the same

In the shadow under the trees  
Down by a stream in a hollow  
Turn your head feel the breeze  
  
And the red Queen was waiting for the news  
For the white King to move  
And the balance hung upon the head of one who tried  
To stay within the shadows  
And keep his undercover secret tight  
  
They let him in by a back way  
Into a chamber reserved for the Queen  
She took the note that he gave her  
Opened it slowly and started to read  
  
Run to the treasury and bring me back some gold  
Give it to the pawn who came, she cried  
He says the white King thinks the game of chess is wrong  
And all the courtiers crowded her  
And this is what she told the gathered round  
  
Go to the store by the dungeon  
Take all the red paint take all the white  
Make up a newborn color  
Cover your neighbor we'll be all right  
  
There will be no game today, she cried across the board  
Everyday will be a holiday  
And all the pieces cheered as tidings spread abroad  
And the Pink Queen sat  
And smiled at the cat who smiled back.

He's taking in his prey in sight it's just a matter of time  
May the games begin the best man win

Is it the fool that wont let it show

But watch your step the ice is thin

It matters not you're lost to him  
If only you could see the mess you're in  
  
Is it the pride in you that wont let go  
Is it the fool that wont let it show?  
  
Free yourself  
If only you could see yourself  
If you could see yourself  
  
And when the heavens opened up and the walls come tumbling down  
You know it is the only place to go  
And when you've had enough of fighting  
And every mean trick under the sun  
But still you fear the worst is yet to come  
Take the money and run

Eardrums drown, the bass pound

Biting and writing and fighting for this  
Beats and wax, rhymes are facts  
Biting acts

Biters around, check out the sound

I'm back  
Back to smack attack  
Those who wack and lack my experience  
On the microphone holding my own ground  
Dominating forces  
Change the sources, punks takes losses  
Enough cause it's me on the mic  
Feeding on words, small like a nerd  
Haven't you heard this change of rhyme  
Continuing the land of time  
For my incredible, highly elevated  
Smooth in the mind, more sophisicated  
Motivated, as I relate it verbal  
Dissing a mouse and smacking any gerbel  
I bought a Saab, a 1990 Turbo  
Shining, fog lights in the front  
I'm by myself, no seats for a stunt  
'Cause I want it like that, I got it like that  
I have it like, I need it like that  
It's better like that, I made it like that  
I bought it like that, I'm living like that  
For you wack MC's  
Who go on the mic and blow on the mic  
And perpetrate frauds and making mistakes  
Like an amateur but I'm a 20 year veteran  
And better than, including the rest of them  
I chew 'em all and spit out the best of them  
One by one, I'm teaching my son  
To ease back

Rocking, slicing, rep is treacherous  
Like a professor, he had perfected this  
Simple potion, through devotion  
Wit his blends, his motions and fastly approaching  
Coasting, reaching higher levels  
So when you see 'em, you best say hello  
I'm a take out a knife,pen and paper and write  
A rhyme so dope you can't think, can't cope  
Ducks, who are you really kidding  
You say you're dope, well you're admitting  
That you can't compete because you're rhymes are weak  
Full of more nonsense, past tense, incomplete  
Weap and learn a new rap style  
From Seth G, the wizard of know how  
An innovation, elevation, psyching the nation

Hello, is it me you're looking for?  
I can see it in your eyes.  
I can see it in your smile.  
You're all I've ever wanted, my arms are open wide.  
'Cause you know just what to say.  
And you know just what to do.  
And I want to tell you so much,  
I love you ...  
I long to see the sunlight in your hair.  
And tell you time and time again  
how much I care.  
Sometimes I feel my heart will overflow.  
Hello, I've just got to let you know.  
'Cause I wonder where you are,  
And I wonder what you do.  
Are you somewhere feeling lonely,  
or is someone loving you?  
Tell me how to win your heart,  
For I haven't got a clue.  
But let me start by saying,  
I love you ...

26541,Bruce Springsteen,Blood Brothers,/b/bruce+springsteen/blood+brothers_20025056.html,"We played king of the mountain out on the end  
The world come chargin' up the hill, and we were women and men  
Now there's so much that time, time and memory fade away  
We got our own roads to ride and chances we gotta take  
We stood side by side each one fightin' for the other  
We said until we died we'd always be blood brothers  
  
Now the hardness of this world slowly grinds your dreams away  
Makin' a fool's joke out of the promises we make  
And what once seemed black and white turns to so many shades of gray  
We lose ourselves in work to do and bills to pay  
And it's a ride, ride, ride, and there ain't much cover  
With no one runnin' by your side my blood brother  
  
On through the houses of the dead past those fallen in their tracks  
Always movin' ahead and never lookin' back  
Now I don't know how I feel, I don't know how I feel tonight  
If I've fallen 'neath the wheel, if I've lost or I've gained sight  
I don't even know why, I don't why I made this call  
Or if any of this matters anymore after all  
  
But the stars are burnin' bright like some mystery uncovered  
I'll keep movin' through the dark with you in my heart  
My blood brother

35204,Hank Williams,THE FUNERAL,/h/hank+williams/the+funeral_20064186.html,"I was walking in Savannah past a church, decayed and dim  
When slowly through the window came a plaintive funeral hymn  
My sympathy awakened and a wonder quickly grew  
'Til I found myself environed in a little colored pew  
Out front a colored couple sat in sorrow nearly wild  
On the altar was a casket and in the casket was a child  
I could picture him while living, curly hair protruding lips  
I'd seen perhaps a thousand in my hurried southern trips  
Then rose a sad, old colored preacher from his little wooden desk  
With a manner sort of awkward and countenance grotesque  
The simplicity and shrewdness in his Ethiopian face  
Showed the wisdom and the ignorance of a crushed, undying race  
And he said, ""Now don't be weepin' for this pretty bit of clay  
For the little boy who lived there has done gone and run away  
He was doing very finely and he 'ppreciates your love  
But his sho nough father wanted him in the big house up above  
The Lord didn't give you that baby, by no hundred thousand miles  
He just think you need some sunshine and he lent it for a while  
And he let you keep and love him 'til your hearts were bigger grown  
And these silver tears you're shedding now, are just interest on the loan  
Just think my poor dear mourners creeping long on sorrow?s way  
What a blessed picnic this here baby got today  
Your good fathers and good mothers crowd the little fella round  
In the angels 'tender garden of the big plantation ground  
And his eyes they brightly sparkle at the pretty things he view  
But a tear came and he whispered, ""I want my parents too""  
Then the angel's chief musicians teach that little boy a song  
Says if only they be faithful, they'll soon be comin' 'long  
And so my poor dear mourners, let your hearts with Jesus rest  
And don't go to criticizn' the one what knows the best  
He has give us many comforts He's got the right to take away  
To the Lord be praised in glory, now and ever, let us pray

And I used to be like that, but not anymore

Can't put it together again

Well, tell me how you gonna feel  
In the middle of the night  
All alone, all alone  
I know, I know  
It doesn't matter who's right or wrong  
If you feel so inclined  
To blame that shame on someone else  
Ooh, stop and think about it  
Point the finger at yourself

Searching for the very souls  
Whom already have been sold.

With a voice without restraint  
""Come out ye gifted kings and queens  
And hear my sad complaint  
No martyr is among ye now  
Whom you can call your own  
So go on your way accordingly  
But know you're not alone"".

So alone and terrified

And bowed my head and cried.

See the clouds and the mountains too

Get a little insane  
Come out and play with me  
Barefoot in the rain

I can make it breathe a breath of life into an old love that has died  
And I can stand and reminisce a while  
In my mind I can be anything I want to be  
In my mind I can do anything I want to do  
Except make my mind forget you  
I can take a journey to the end of the rainbow

I can change a heartache into a tiny snowflake  
And I can take December and turn it into June  
In my mind I can be anything I want to be...

The dew had finished making love to many  
A rainbow smelling sweet was in the air  
I envied all the silence I saw growing  
So unmoved by things outside of themselves  
And how I wished that I could come back as a flower

Under the marble and the snow  
I said, Mother I'm frightened  
The thunder and the lightning  
I'll never come through this alone  
She said, I'll be with you  
My shawl wrapped around you  
My hand on your head when you go  
And the night came on  
It was very calm  
  
I wanted the night to go on and on  
But she said, Go back to the World  
We were fighting in Egypt  
When they signed this agreement  
That nobody else had to die  
There was this terrible sound  
And my father went down  
With a terrible wound in his side  
He said, Try to go on  
Take my books, take my gun  
Remember, my son, how they lied  
And the night comes on

But you don't want to lie, not to the young

I took to religion  
And I wondered how long she would stay  
I needed so much  
To have nothing to touch  
I've always been greedy that way  
But my son and my daughter  
Climbed out of the water  
Crying, Papa, you promised to play  
And they lead me away  
To the great surprise  
It's Papa, don't peek, Papa, cover your eyes  
And they hide, they hide in the World  
  
Now I look for her always  
I'm lost in this calling  
I'm tied to the threads of some prayer  
Saying, When will she summon me  
When will she come to me  
What must I do to prepare  
When she bends to my longing  
Like a willow, like a fountain  
She stands in the luminous air  
And the night comes on  
And it's very calm  
I lie in her arms and says, When I'm gone  
I'll be yours, yours for a song  
  
Now the crickets are singing  
The vesper bells ringing  
The cat's curled asleep in his chair  
I'll go down to Bill's Bar  
I can make it that far  
And I'll see if my friends are still there  
Yes, and here's to the few  
Who forgive what you do  
And the fewer who don't even care  
And the night comes on  
It's very calm  
I want to cross over, I want to go home  
But she says, Go back, go back to the World

Reach out, it's time to, time to, time to,  
To, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to.

An endangered species?

With inspiration for life.

I gave you my love to borrow,

I don't expect you to care  
I know I've said it before,  
But all of our bridges burned down  
  
I've wasted my nights,  
You turned out the lights

Still stuck in that time,

Man, fuck that shit  
I'll be out spending all this money  
While you're sitting round wondering  
Why it wasn't you who came up from nothing,  
Made it from the bottom  
Now when you see me I'm stunting,  
And all of my cars start with a push of a button  
  
Telling me the chances I blew up  
Or whatever you call it,  
Switch the number to my phone  
So you never could call it,  
Don't need my name on my show,  
You can tell it I'm ballin'  
  
Swish, what a shame could have got picked  
Had a really good game but you missed your last shot  
So you talk about who you see at the top  
Or what you could have saw but sad to say it's over for  
Phantom pulled up valet open doors  
Wiz like go away, got what you was looking for  
Now it's me who they want, so you can go and take  
that little piece of shit with you

I couldn't read your mind  
Line after line

It was written in your eyes  
I guess it's no surprise

I can hear them whispering  
Shadows in the rain  
Thinking how it might have been

Line after line, you broke me

I wanted love to stay

The foolish things we say  
The pain won't go away

Slowly and lowly is heard now the reel's sound  
Noisless and light to the lattice above

Don't you lie no more  
You tought me the way  
To be a winner  
And never to play  
On the losing side  
I guess that I turned out  
The way you always planned  
So hard to cross that line  
But the words have got to come  
From you this time

And imagine what it's gonna be when we get inside

To find the sun  
She lost her name  
But found a new one  
Amy goes to school all day  
But at night in the neighborhood  
They call her  
Amphetamine  
  
She is perfect in that fucked up way  
That all the magazines  
Seem to want to glorify these days  
  
She looks like a teenage anthem  
She looks like she used to be happy with  
The girl inside  
  
She looks so bored sometimes  
She has that super pale skin  
And those soft green eyes  
She looks like she  
Could have been happy  
In a better life  
  
She came out west  
Just to break away clean  
From her family and her friends  
And a little girl's dream  
All she wants to do every night  
Is to sit beside my window  
And listen to the sirens  
  
She is perfect in that fucked up way  
That all the magazines  
Seem to want to glorify these days

She looks like she should have been happy  
In another life  
  
In another life  
  
She came out west  
Just to break the spell  
After three long years'  
In a marriage from hell  
Six months clean  
Living sober and right  
The doctors tell her  
Everything will be alright  
  
Yeah you just take your pill  
And everything will be alright

She looks like a magazine girl  
She looks like a teenage anthem

In another world  
  
She looks like a teenage anthem  
She is happy with the girl inside  
She looks like a teenage anthem  
And looks like she could have been  
Happy in another life  
  
In another life  
Happy in another life  
  
Met her at a party  
And I took her home  
She is the saddest girl  
That I have ever known  
She wakes me up  
In the middle of the night  
Just to tell me  
Everything will be alright

Everything will be alright  
  
I tell myself the same damn thing  
  
Everyday  
  
Everything will be alright

To quench all the death I breed  
Recreate the rules of play

None have ever won my game  
Crucified them all in flames  
  
Have you ever danced with the devil  
His temptation ever summoned you  
Ever penned your name in blood  
Let possession slowly swallow you  
When you stand under full moonlight  
The attraction mesmerizes you  
Have you ever wondered why  
It seems that evil you're attracted to  
  
Reach out to my hand  
Step back in time's sand  
Genetic wasteland  
Far beyond death

And I can hear her boots as she's near her home  
Well, you can't refuse and you just can't choose what she's gonna do  
Well, you can't refuse and you just can't choose what she's gonna do  
  
[Chorus:]  
Scratch, scratch, she's clawing at the door  
Whoa, no, I can't take it anymore  
Crack, crack I'm feeling so sore  
I never should asked for black leather  
Black leather  
Ooh, black leather  
Ow black leather  
  
And you can try to hide, but you won't get far  
You can let her in, and you'll start it again  
Well, you can't refuse and you just can't choose what she's gonna do  
Well, you can't refuse and you just can't choose what she's gonna do  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Ooh  
Ooh  
Black leather [x 8]

She carries no guarantees  
But still I can't seem to  
Find a reason that I can believe in

And give you some room  
You said you had changes  
You need to work through  
But the longer I wait  
The farther I feel from you.

But then nature didn't make him that way

Will protect him that we will respect him

Who just pretend that they like him  
He does the same to them, and when you put it all together  
There's the model of a charmless man  
  
He knows the swingers and their cavalry  
Says he can get in anywhere for free

And from this charmless man I just had to hide

He doesn't see his days  
Are tumbling down upon him  
And yet he tries so hard to please  
He's just so keen for you to listen

And solemn, waiting Old Man in the gables of the roof, he tells me truth  
  
And I, too, live inside me and very often don't know who I am,  
I know, I'm not a hero, I hope that I'm not damned

9595,John Prine,John Prine Christmas,/j/john+prine/john+prine+christmas_20074812.html,"Pretty paper  
Pretty ribbons of blue.  
  
Man oh man,  
I just love Christmas it's just so darn neat.  
I kinda wish every day was Christmas,  
Except Christmas eve and the Fourth of July.  
We wouldn't want to miss out on the fireworks, would we?  
When I was a kid, we used to get the Christmas catalog from Montgomery Wards
in Chicago.  
Sometimes we'd get it as early as late August.  
It was the big book of wishes, hopes and desires.  
My three brothers and I were allotted twenty-five bucks a piece, including
tax.  
  
So I'd make up a different Christmas list every night  
From the first of September 'til the twenty-forth of December.  
Matter of fact, let me present you with my Christmas credentials.  
When I was three years old, at least that's what my mother told me,  
I ate an entire ornament. I ate a big red one, I thought it was an apple.  
They kinda freaked out and was gonna take me to the hospital  
But they couldn't stop me from laughing so they just left me alone.  
So I guess I still got that Christmas in me all the time, you know?  
  
One year, I got a wooden Roly-Poly for Christmas,  
You know the things you knock down and they bounce right back up.  
They made 'em out of wood back then, that's how old I am.  
Nowadays, they make 'em out of plastic.  
My mom says, ""They just don't make 'em like that anymore.""  
And I says, ""No ma, they don't"".  
  
Then there was the year I came home only eave from the army,  
From Germany to marry my high school sweetheart on the day after Christmas.  
My little brother Billy, who was twelve at the time,  
Had just gotten his first job so he was able to afford to buy some Christmas
presents  
For his brothers and his mom and dad out of his own pocket.  
Billy had a job selling subscriptions for the Chicago Tribune.  
He told me this guy named Rocky would pick him up in a station wagon,  
Him and some other boys, and he'd take 'em out to some strange neighborhood  
And drop 'em off and he gave them this whole spiel to give their potential
customers.  
Supposedly their little brother had won a free trip to our nation's capital
Washington, D.C.,  
But he couldn't go on the trip if his older brother wouldn't accompany him  
So if you would please buy a subscription to the Chicago Tribune  
Then my little brother will be happy.  
Wow, what a shyster! Some people'll do anything to get to the Whitehouse.  
  
Then there was the year that my mom and dad gave me my first guitar.  
Ah man it was gorgeous, I still got the thing.  
It was a like aqua blue.  
Kinda dark aqua blue with a cream colored heart.  
Was a Silvertone from Montgomery Wards.  
The model was called Kentucky Blue  
And man when I saw that sitting under the tree I just couldn't wait.  
First year so I didn't know how to play it,  
I'd just stand in front of the mirror with a string  
Around my neck with that guitar and I'd try to look like Elvis.  
Then my brother Dave taught me a couple of chords,  
Now I'm here in your living room singing and talking to you.  
It's funny how things work out.  
  
So-a whyn't you go find a stranger and extend your hand to 'em.  
If you see somebody looks like  
They ain't doin' quite as well as you, slip 'em a buck,  
'specially if they don't ask for spare change.  
Go buy your honey a cuckoo clock or a musical snow shaking water ball,  
That when you wind it up it plays,  
""I want you, I need you, I love ya with all my heart.""  
'cause after all, hell man, it's Christmas.  
  
Away in a manger no crib for a bed.  
The little Lord Jesus lay down his sweet head.  
The stars in the sky look down where he lay.  
The little Lord Jesus asleep on the (1-2) hay.  
  
Merry Christmas Everybody.

Win or lose, it's all up to you  
I can't believe that you could let me go this far  
It can't be natural to be the way you are  
Do something, do something  
I've got this weakness, I'm losing power  
I need your sweetness right here and now yeah  
Deeper and deeper, hour after hour  
I should be ruling but I'm not satisfied no, no  
Not satisfied, I'm not satisfied  
When I'm alone, can't do it on the phone  
Won't let you go until I get just what I need  
My heart is breaking oh baby baby please  
Do something do something baby baby okay  
Come on come on come on do something  
Get down on your knees and do something  
Oh baby, please, do something

Went driving through the night  
Miles and miles without a word  
With just his high-beam lights  
  
Who'd have ever thought  
They'd build such a deadly Denver bend  
To be so strong, to take so long  
As it would till the end

His silver string guitar  
And he played to people everywhere  
Some say he was a star  
  
But he was just a country boy  
His simple songs confess  
And the music he had in him  
So very few possess  
  
In my hour of darkness  
In my time of need  
Oh Lord, grant me vision  
Oh Lord, grant me speed  
  
Then there was an old man  
Kind and wise with age  
And he read me just like a book  
And he never missed a page  
  
And I loved him like my father  
And I loved him like my friend  
And I knew his time would shortly come  
But I did not know just when

If you see me gettin' smaller I'm leavin' don't be grieving  
Just got to get away from here  
If you see me gettin' smaller don't worry and no hurry I've got the right to
disappear  
  
God bless old Philadelphia they were standing in the rain  
Out in front of a main yard wet and lonely train  
Who knows who they came to see a mad man full of beer  
A four piece band and a charter bus my border-line career  
If you see me gettin' smaller

33129,Free,The Highway Song,/f/free/the+highway+song_21017008.html,"So we started in the cornfield  
And I know we did not slack  
We got everything in order  
But we forgot to bring the bucket back  
The foreman he went crazy  
And ran around the field  
Said we must be lazy  
Had to be seen to be believed  
Seen to be believed.  
  
But it was a long way  
From this highroad  
It was a far away from here.  
  
The farmer had a daughter  
And she worked at the wishing well  
Put one leg in the water  
'Til she found the mission bell  
The old man went crazy  
And ran to get his gun  
We had a bad time explaining  
We were just having drunken fun  
Just having drunken fun.  
  
But it was a long way  
From this high road, Oh!  
It was a long way from here  
So we walked along this road  
Just tellin' stories as we go  
We just walk along.  
  
Well the farmer had a daughter  
And she did not speak a word  
We used to kiss her in the orchard  
Till one morning we were overheard  
The old man he went crazy  
Running around the field  
Said we must be crazy  
Had to be seen to be believed  
Seen to be believed

Not too long ago  
A misty blue and the lilac too  
A never to grow old.  
  
A there you were under the tree of song  
Sleeping so peacefully  
In your hand a flower played  
A waiting there for me.  
  
I have never  
Laid eyes on you  
Not like a before  
This timeless day  
A but you woke and ya ha  
Oh, ya smiled my name  
And you stole  
My heart away  
A stole my heart away little girl, yeah  
All right !  
  
Golden rose, the color of the dream I had  
Not too long ago  
Misty blue and lilac too  
A never to grow old.  
  
Golden rose, the color of the dream I had  
Misty blue and lilac too  
Golden rose, the color of the dream I had  
Misty blue and lilac too  
Gold and rose, gold are rose, gold and rose.  
  
It's only a dream  
I'd love to tell somebody about this dream  
The sky was filled with a thousand stars  
While the sun kissed the mountains blue  
And eleven moons played across rainbows  
Above me and you.  
Gold and rose the color of the velvet walls surround us.

53051,Thin Lizzy,Honesty Is No Excuse,/t/thin+lizzy/honesty+is+no+excuse_20136665.html,"Up till now I used to pass my time  
Drinking beer so slowly, sometimes wine  
No God, air, water or sunshine  
And honesty was my only excuse  
I took your love and I used it  
Up till now my youthful stage  
A useless rage, a torn out page, a worn out gauge  
A dirty shade, a big charade, a has been made  
And honesty was my only excuse  
I took your love and I used it  
I never, I never, I never  
Up till now my love life  
Few sweet kisses, a little missus, a fork and knife  
A happy home, a hand to hold, a land to roam  
And honesty was my only excuse  
I used to take life in my own hands and I abused it  
Up till now I used to tap dance  
Take a girl by the hand saying  
""I need your, I need your romance""  
Oh I had me many chances  
And honesty was my only excuse  
I used to take your love and I'd abused it  
Up till now the path of life was fair enough  
Enough was fair, all was right  
And now I know, I see the light  
And honesty was my only excuse
