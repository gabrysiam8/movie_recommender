A little babe so dear  
With noble light he shineth  
As shines a mirror clear  
This little babe so dear.  
  
The babe within the cradle  
Is Jesus Christ our Lord  
To us all peace and amity  
At this good time afford  
Thou Jesus Christ our Lord!  
  
Whoso would rock the cradle  
Where lies the gentle child  
A lowly heart must lead him  
By passions undefiled  
As Mary pure and mild.  
  
O Jesus, babe beloved  
O Jesus, babe divine  
How mighty is thy wondrous love  
Fill thou this heart of mine  
With that great love of thine!

Like wounded soldiers in need of healing  
Time to be honest, this time I'm pleading,  
Please don't dwell on it, 'cause I didn't mean it  
  
I can't believe I said I'd lay our love on the ground,  
But it doesn't matter 'cause I made it up, forgive me now  
Everyday I spend away, my soul's inside out,  
Gotta be some way that I can make it up to you now, somehow  
  
[Chorus]  
By now you know that I'd come for you  
No one but you, yes, I'd come for you  
But only if you told me to  
And I'd fight for you  
I'd lie, it's true  
Give my life for you  
You know I'd always come for you  
  
I was blindfolded, but now I'm seeing,  
My mind was closing, now I'm believing  
I finally know just what it means to let someone in,  
To see the side of me that no one does, or ever will  
So if you're ever lost and find yourself all alone,  
I'd search forever just to bring you home,  
Here and now, this I vow  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You know I'd always come for you  
  
No matter what gets in my way  
As long as there's still life in me  
No matter what, remember  
You know I'd always come for you  
  
Yes I'd come for you, no one but you,  
Yes I'd come for you, but only if you told me to  
  
And I'd fight for you,  
I'd lie, it's true  
Give my life for you,  
You know I'd always come for you  
  
No matter what gets in my way,  
As long as there's still life in me  
No matter what, remember, you know I'd always come for you  
I'd crawl across this world for you,  
Do anything you want me to  
No matter what, remember, you know I'd always come for you  
You know I'd always come for you.

In her rickshaw on the street or in a cabaret

Oriental music and you in my arms  
Perfumed flowers in your tresses  
Lotus-scented breezes and swaying palms

Fragrant and slender 'neath tropical skies  
I must cross the seas again and never see you more  
Way back to my home on a distant shore

Kiss me farewell now, there's nothing to say

In a different city  
A smile on my face

Hear the radio playin' my song  
I still get butterflies  
Still get nervous inside  
In the spotlight  
  
Now every now n then  
On a friday night  
Cruisin' down to the dive bar  
We waste the night away  
Spend saturday sleepin' in late

Waiting for the rainbow's end

And turn your world around

The question you have found  
Looking for  
An open door  
  
You don't get something for nothing  
You don't get freedom for free  
You won't get wise  
With the sleep still in your eyes  
No matter what your dreams might be  
  
What you own is your own kingdom  
What you do is your own glory  
What you love is your own power  
What you live is your own story  
In your head is the answer  
Let it guide you along  
Let your heart be the anchor  
And the beat of your own song

We've been watching you with all of our eyes  
And what you seem to value most  
  
So much potential

Your greed, self importance, and your arrogance  
You piss it all away  
  
We heard a cry  
We've come to intervene  
You will change your ways, and you will make amends  
Or we will wipe this place clean

Alright, so this is really fucked up, but  
Alright, I was sleeping next to him but I was dreaming about the other dude  
And then all of a sudden, everything that he fucking did just made me cringe
and it was so hard to fall in but so easy just to fall back right out again  
This whole time, I could give to you and I could paint you pictures but I
guess I could just never write a song and then maybe I'd never fell out of
love with him in the first place  
I mean, I, I don't wanna feel this feeling cause my energy's just so strong
that, I don't know if I'm creating this or this is actually what is meant to
be  
And you know that, they say that you gotta think what you want into existence,
but you know, I haven't been too good at making decisions so, I have no idea
what the fuck I want, I guess  
  
[Chorus 1]  
You're giving me a feeling in my head  
Laying in my bed just thinking  
Not really feeling like the one I want  
Takes everything in me not to call him  
I really, really, really want it, too  
I told all my friends I'm moving on  
Your baby talk is creeping me out  
Fuck me so you stop baby talking  
  
[Verse 2]  
You know what, in the beginning it was like we were fucking homies and shit
and then all of a sudden you started with some fucking baby goo-goo tongue
down my fucking throat  
I mean, even in front of your mom  
Dude, as if I'm not fucking awkward enough  
I mean, you put me in these fucking situations where I look like a dumbass
bitch and I'm not a fucking dumbass bitch  
You know, like, I hate all that fucking PDA, I probably hate it more than your
fucking friends do  
You know, it's sweet and you couldn't be more opposite of my last dickhead
but, you know I just, I don't know if I can get over the fucking goo  
  
[Chorus 2]  
You keep saying again and again  
We're laying in my bed just talking  
And now I, now I can't hold it back  
I'm feeling like I'm gonna vomit  
I don't really want to let go of you  
I heard I change my mind with you often  
Baby talk is creeping me out  
Fuck me so you stop baby talking  
  
[Verse 3]  
Alright, so, I'm gonna be honest  
It's the super cutey shit, that's the main issue here  
I mean, I'm fucking what?  
Look, I like when you send me, you know, the, the queen emoji, but when I send
back the monkey, you know, the ones with the, the hands over the eyes? That
means that shit's just getting a little too weird for me  
I mean, I don't wanna say it person, I just bury my head in your armpit
which... weirdly smells good and your hair and your fucking teeth  
Like, why the fuck would I wanna lick your teeth but I do  
And remember there was that one time that I had like a 15 minute...  
Well, that was kind of the best thing in the entire world  
You know, maybe I could just get past this shit and I could get used to
someone giving a fuck  
I'm sorry I called you a creep and that thing about the vomit  
I mean, look, I'm really starting to be in this whole thing, but no matter
what you do, homegirl can't handle the fucking goo  
  
[Chorus 3]  
Fuck me so you stop baby talking  
Fuck me so you stop baby talking  
Fuck me so you stop baby talking  
Fuck me so you stop baby talking  
I don't really want [?] you  
I heard I change my mind with you often  
Baby talk is creeping me out  
Fuck me so you stop baby talking

Stumbling through the devil-dark  
With the hound pack in full cry  
  
Have mercy on the criminal

Are you blind to the winds of change  
Don't you hear him any more  
  
Praying Lord you got to help me  
I am never gonna sin again  
Just take these chains from around my legs  
Sweet Jesus I'll be your friend  
  
Now have you ever seen the white teeth gleam  
While you lie on a cold damp ground  
You're taking in the face of a rifle butt  
While the wardens hold you down  
  
And you've never seen a friend in years  
Oh it turns your heart to stone  
You jump the walls and the dogs run free  
And the grave's gonna be your home

Every night he sings so happily, so his lady love can hear.  
In a manner oh gravissimo, he repeats his serenade,  
And his heart beats so fortissimo, when she raises her Venetian shade.  
Ciribiribin, chiribiribin, ciribiribin.  
Ciribiribin, he waits for her each night beneath her balcony.  
Ciribiribin, he begs to hold her tight, but no, she won't agree.  
Ciribiribin, she throws a rose and blows a kiss from up above,  
Ciribiribin, ciribiribin, ciribiribin, they're so in love.  
(musical interlude)  
Ciribiribin, ciribiribin, ciribiribin, they're so in love.

I wasn't ready for romance?  
Didn't we promise  
We would only be friends?  
And so we danced  
Though it was only a slow dance,  
I started breaking my promises right there and then  
  
Didn't I swear  
There would be no complications?  
Didn't you want  
Someone who's seen it all before?  
Now that you're here  
It's not the same situation,  
Suddenly I don't remember the rules anymore  
  
This night is mine  
It's only you and I  
Tomorrow is a long time away  
This night can last forever  
  
I've been around  
Someone like me should know better  
Falling in love  
Would be the worst thing I could do  
Didn't I say  
I needed time to forget her?  
Aren't you running  
From someone who's not over you?  
  
How many nights  
Have I been lonely without you?  
I tell myself  
How much I really don't care  
How many nights  
Have I been thinking about you?  
Wanting to hold you  
But knowing you would not be there  
  
But this night you're mine  
It's only you and I  
I'll tell you to forget yesterday  
This night we are together  
  
This night is mine  
It's only you and I  
Tomorrow is a long time away  
This night can last forever

How small the voice I humbly bring

The overflow of those who know  
They have seen You  
We are disgraced, but You graced us  
With the warmth of Your forgiveness  
Now You lead us ever closer  
To the pure light of Your holiness  
And I'll sing of the wonders of Your grace

Sometimes we just went for a swim

Made me feel so warm inside  
All the time her smile glowing

Before I hit the ground

If you can abide it  
Let the hurdy gurdy play  
Stranger ones have come by here  
Before they flew away  
I will not condemn you  
Nor yet would I deny

Take up your china doll

And a little nervous from the fall

Then Harley junior joined some kind of rockband

His wife watched TV all the time cause she got bored  
Then one day she found a TV preacher she adored  
And she gave all of Harley's hard earned money to the Lord  
Harley started drinkin' wound up in Betty Ford to see if he could by a

I spied wings of reason, herself taking flight  
And upon yonder precipice saw her alight  
And glared back at me one last look of dismay  
As if she were the last one she thought I'd betray

And drawing quite close to the top of the shelf  
I struggled with destiny upon the ledge  
And gasped when defeated he slipped off the edge  
And silence contagious in moments like these  
Consumed me and strengthened my will to appease  
The passion that sparked me one terrible night  
And shocked and persuaded my soul to ignite

The tears and fears begin to multiply.  
  
Take a time in a simple place,  
On my bed, where my head rests on a pillow case,  
And it's said that a war 's led but I forget that  
I let another day go by.  
  
I want to be afraid,  
But it seems that these days,  
I'm caught under water,  
And I'm falling farther,  
My heart 's getting harder,  
I'm calling my Father,  
Am I screaming to an empty sky?  
  
Empty sky, no way that's me,  
'Cause one half of my heart is free.  
Empty sky, no way that's me,  
'Cause the other half of my heart's asleep.  
  
[Chorus]  
Sing a song, but don't believe.  
Blasphemy is just for me.  
Hypocrite, take your pick,  
'Cause the poison 's on my lips  
Can I understand you? (4x)  
[End Chorus]  
  
Lights, camera, action.  
Satisfaction at your fingertips,  
No one's lacking stuff,  
But it's not enough when it seems  
We have enough stuff just to blow stuff up.  
  
Lights, camera, stop!  
We're killing ourselves  
Just to get to the top,  
And we wont stop talking about what we got,  
And how we all love it when we're loved a lot.  
  
Enough about you, let's talk about me,  
And everybody thinks I'm just so free.  
Free? Did you hear the verse that came first,  
And how my whole body 's waging a war on me?  
  
I bet you didn't know something that's absurd,  
There's a word I've said more than any other word.  
It's sorry. I'm sorry.  
And I pray that the word was heard.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I want to be alive,  
When you see my eyes,  
Can I see your eyes?  
  
Can I see your eyes (5x)  
  
I want to be alive,  
When you see my eyes,  
Can I see your eyes?  
Can I see your eyes?  
  
Let the water...  
Wash away...  
Everything that you've become.  
On your knees...  
Today is gone...  
And tomorrow is sure to come.  
  
Tomorrow is sure to come.

In this God forsaken place  
When my confidence was well, then I tripped and I felt  
Right flat on my face  
Now I'm standing erect, and I feel like coming back  
And the sun is shining gold  
Put a smile on my face, get back in the human race  
And get on with the show  
  
And I'm taking in the Indian Summer  
And I'm soaking it up in my mind  
And I'm pretending that it's paradise  
On a golden autumn day, on a golden autumn day  
On a golden autumn day, an a golden autumn day  
  
In the wee midnight hour I was parking my car  
In this dimly lit town,  
I was attacked by two thugs, who took me for a mug  
And shoved me down on the ground  
And they pulled out a knife, and I fought my way up  
As they scarpered from the scene  
Well this is no New York street, and there's no Bobby on the beat  
And things ain't just what they seem  
  
And I'm taking in the Indian Summer  
And I'm soaking it up in my mind  
And I'm pretending that it's paradise  
On a golden autumn day, on a golden autumn day  
On a golden autumn day, an a golden autumn day  
  
Who would think this could happen in a city like this  
Among Blake's green and pleasant hills,  
And we must remember as we go through September  
Among these dark satanic mills  
If there's such a thing as justice I could take them out and flog them  
In the nearest green field  
And it might be a lesson to the bleeders of the system  
In this whole society  
  
And I'm taking in the Indian Summer  
And I'm soaking it up in my mind  
And I'm pretending like it's paradise  
On a golden autumn day, on a golden autumn day  
On a golden autumn day, on a golden autumn day, golden autumn day ...

She may be just a slob,  
But to me, well,  
She's my girl.  
In winter the bedroom is one large ice cube,  
And she squeezes the toothpaste from the middle of the tube.  
Her hairs in the sink  
Have driven me to drink,  
But she's my girl, she's my girl, she's my girl,  
And I love her.  
The girl that I lament for,  
The girl my money's spent for,  
The girl my back is bent for,  
The girl I owe the rent for,  
The girl I gave up lent for  
Is the girl that heaven meant for me.  
So though for breakfast she makes coffee that tastes like shampoo,  
I come home for dinner and get peanut butter stew,  
Or if I'm in luck,  
It's broiled hockey puck,  
But, oh well, what the hell,  
She's my girl,  
And I love her.

With each lie that you tell  
And the old ways will go out with the new some way

When the banks all close  
With the stars above  
Lonely won't be lonesome  
When we get through  
And uh uh baby want to be with you  
Uh uh baby want to be with you

Tomorrow knows tomorrow woes

Now comes the moon with its starry lights  
And so begins the night life  
The tribal dance puts me in a trance  
As she pulls me in with her magic swing  
I asked of her what do we celebrate  
She said to me these be the good old days

Let's cherish these moments that we now know

25850,Bob Dylan,I And I,/b/bob+dylan/i+i_20021394.html,"Been so long since a strange woman has slept in my bed  
Look how sweet she sleeps, how free must be her dreams  
In another lifetime she must have owned the world, or been faithfully wed  
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlit streams.  
  
I and I  
In creation where one's nature neither honors nor forgives  
I and I  
One say to the other, no man sees my face and lives.  
  
Think I'll go out and go for a walk  
Not much happening here, nothing ever does  
Besides, if she wakes up now, she'll just want to talk  
I got nothing to say, 'specially about whatever it was.  
  
I and I  
In creation where one's nature neither honors nor forgives  
I and I  
One say to the other, no man see my face and lives.  
  
Took an untrodden path once, where the swift don't win the race  
It goes to the worthy, who can divide the word of truth  
Took a stranger to teach me, to look into justice's beautiful face  
And see an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.  
  
I and I  
In creation where one's nature neither honors nor forgives  
I and I  
One say to the other, no man sees my face and lives.  
  
Outside of two men on a train platform there's nothing in sight  
They're waiting for spring to come, smoking down the trck  
The world could come to an end tonight, bt that's all right  
She could still be there sleeping when I get back.  
  
I and I  
In creation where one's nature neither honors nor forgives  
I and I  
One say to the other, no man sees my face and lives.  
  
Noontime, and I'm still pushing myself along the road, the darkest part  
Into the narrow lanes, I can't stumble or stay put  
Someone else is speaking with my mouth, but I'm listening with my heart  
I've made shoes for everyone, even you, while I go barefoot.  
  
I and I  
In creation where one's nature neither honors nor forgives  
I and I  
One say to the other, no man sees my face and lives.

To drive the dreams he had away  
He wanted to believe  
In the hands of love

As he cut across the land  
A dog started crying  
Like a broken hearted man  
At the howling wind  
At the howling wind  
  
He went deeper into black  
Deeper into white  
Could see the stars shining  
Like nails in the night  
He felt the healing  
Healing, healing  
Healing hands of love  
Like the stars shiny shiny  
From above  
  
Hand in the pocket  
Finger on the steel  
The pistol weighed heavy  
His heart he could feel  
Was beating, beating  
Beating, beating oh my love  
Oh my love, oh my love  
Oh my love

Saw the hands that build  
Can also pull down

They killed a man I really loved  
Shot him through the head.  
Lord, Lord,  
They cut George Jackson down.  
Lord, Lord,  
They laid him in the ground.  
  
Sent him off to prison  
For a seventy-dollar robbery.  
Closed the door behind him  
And they threw away the key.  
Lord, Lord, They cut George Jackson down.  
Lord, Lord,  
They laid him in the ground.  
  
He wouldn't take shit from no one  
He wouldn't bow down or kneel.  
Authorities, they hated him  
Because he was just too real.  
Lord, Lord,  
They cut George Jackson down.  
Lord, Lord,  
They laid him in the ground.  
  
Prison guards, they cursed him  
As they watched him from above  
But they were frightened of his power  
They were scared of his love.  
Lord, Lord,  
So they cut George Jackson down.  
Lord, Lord,  
They laid him in the ground.  
  
Sometimes I think this whole world  
Is one big prison yard.

The rest of us are guards.

Wishing is good time wasted,  
Still it's a habit they say,  
Wishing for sweet's I've tasted,  
That's all I do all day.  
Maybe there's nothing in wishing,  
But, speaking of wishing I'll say,  
  
Nothing could be finer  
Than to be in Carolina  
In the morning.  
  
No one could be sweeter  
Than my sweetie when I meet her  
In the morning.  
  
When the morning glories  
Twine around the door  
Whispering pretty stories  
I long to hear once more  
Strolling with my girlie  
Where the dew is pearly early  
In the morning.  
  
Butterflies all flutter up  
And kiss each little buttercup  
At dawning.  
If I had Aladdin's lamp  
For only a day  
I'd make a wish  
And here's what I'd say  
  
Nothing could be finer  
Than to be in Carolina  
In the morning.  
  
Dreaming was meant for night time  
I live in dreams all the day,  
I know it's not the right time,  
But still I dream away  
What could be sweeter than dreaming,  
Just dreaming and drift away.  
  
Nothing could be finer  
Than to be in Carolina  
In the morning.  
  
No one could be sweeter  
Than my sweetie when I meet her  
In the morning.  
  
When the morning glories  
Twine around the door  
Whispering pretty stories

Sunday dawn you met a Gypsy woman  
On a road to Tennessee  
She told you a lot about the world to come  
But did she tell you  
Why you couldn't tell me  
Like a runaway  
How one by one you run away  
Now tell me baby  
What you want me to do  
Givin' all my love to you  
Mama don't you know  
  
It's gonna be a hard leavin'  
You're gonna need a strong reason  
'Cause I ain't gonna start believin'  
That you're out of my life  
You bet you better do your fast talkin'  
Before you do your last walkin'  
It's gonna be a hard hard leavin' (talk to me)  
Vox humana  
I wanta feel the power of speech  
Vox humana  
Sounds so right so real to me  
Vox humana  
You gotta say  
What you oughtta say  
Don't try to run away  
Darlin' I'm lettin' you know

But she knew in her heart there had to be something better somewhere.  
Well the boys in the school, they were just a bunch of fools  
And they acted like a bunch of bad bumpkins.

Pictures of his room (pictures of his room!)

of her life...

Got on the stinking yellow cab, put the money through the hole  
And she stared out the window, all the way down Fifth Avenue.  
She went on all the cattle calls just like all the other girls  
And she waited by the phone in her rollers and her curls  
  
But she knew in her heart there had to be something better.  
Well she ran into this guy who was down at 54  
Had a lot of gold and chains and he got her in the door,  
And he knew so many people, and he made her lots of pretty promises.

Full of disdain and fury  
I kept my angered yearning  
Close to me like fire burning  
I watched a million chances  
Slip through my weathered hands  
I almost lost myself when I looked around  
There was nobody else  
[Chorus:]  
In the nick of time  
You opened up my mind  
And suddenly I saw the world much clearer  
In the nick of time  
You turned my water to wine  
And suddenly I didn't feel the fear  
Right before my eyes  
You showed me there was life that to be found  
You're the miracle I prayed about you  
You were the one to save my life  
In the nick of time  
I followed habits around  
Been swept above off the clouds  
But fallen down left shaken  
Abandened by the pills I'd taken  
I could have kept on going  
With no one ever knowing  
Who really wants to see a tired nobody like me  
[Chorus (2x)]  
I could not, I could not believe  
That you were right there waiting  
I never, no, I never dreamed  
That you'd be right there waiting  
Oh you were there for me  
And when I couldn't see,  
I couldn't, no, I couldn't see

And I'll always love you  
And nobody can make me do wrong  
Take me for granted  
Leaving love unshown  
Makes will power weak  
And temptation strong

A woman's only human  
You should understand  
She's not just a plaything  
She's flesh and blood  
Just like her man  
If you want a do right all's day woman  
You gotta be a do right all's night man  
They say it's a man's world  
But you can't prove that by me  
And as long as we're together  
Show some respect for me  
If you want a do right all's day woman  
You gotta be a do right all's night man

If you want a do right all's day woman  
You gotta be a do right all's night man  
If you want a do right all's day woman

He was a dumb-lookin', scrawny, little four-eyed freak  
He never used to hang around with the guys  
He'd just sit in the corner, attractin' the flies  
  
He wasn't much to look at  
He never was very bright  
But at least there was one thing that he could do all right  
That boy could dance  
  
He was kind of a jerk  
He was kind of a bore  
But the women would scream when he walked in the door  
'cause one thing I could tell you for sure  
That boy could dance  
  
Picking teams, he would always be last  
He couldn't run very far,  
He couldn't think very fast  
If he was on your side, you'd always lose  
The guy had a problem, even tying his shoes  
  
He never passed his drivers test  
He was always afraid of cars  
And he had a complexion that resembled the surface of Mars  
But that boy could dance  
  
Well, his hair was a mess  
And his clothes didn't fit  
He smelled pretty bad, and he drooled just a bit  
But you gotta admit  
Boy, that boy could dance  
  
Now that boy is much older  
He's got his own dance studio  
He's got a teeny bopper fan club  
Yeah, he's got his own TV show  
Now he owns half of Montana  
They all call him ""Diamond Jim""  
And you know I'd do anything if I could be just like him  
'cause that boy could dance

She was in the bedroom with another guy  
  
And I don't really want to know  
So don't tell me anymore  
And I really don't want to hear  
About her feet all up in the air

I'm not the one who messed up big time

Think they're gonna help me open up my eyes

Makes me want to lose it  
Every time you do it man it turns the knife  
  
Now I don't need to hear  
About the sounds they were making  
And I don't need to hear  
About how long it was taking  
Or how the walls they were shaking  
  
Now lying in bed, wallowing in sorrow  
Missing the tomorrow that we could have had  
Running through my head, over and over  
Things I never told her now just make me sad  
  
And it drives me insane  
Sitting with the vision  
Stuck with that image burned into my brain  
And I feel so dumb  
That I could ever trust her  
While someone else fucked her  
Then walked away

Ooh  
Aaaah!  
  
Lay back and groove on a rainy day  
Lay back and groove on a rainy day  
Lay back and groove on a rainy day  
Lay back and groove on a rainy day  
Lay back and dream on a rainy day.  
  
Still rainin' still dreamin'.

[Kanye West]  
Heavy hitters fo' life, heavy hitters fo' life  
  
You rappers think I give a fuck about the way that they spit  
Want to be on my album but don't want me on they shit  
Everybody thought I was makin' a compilation  
I was really makin' myself, they competition  
Fresh off the plane from the All-Star game  
Hoes from on TV so it's All-Star trains  
Just picture man, no snitchin' man  
Somethin' for the fiends fresh out the kitchen man  
Last 9.11 I was poor on the ave  
'Til I pulled out my map  
Not it's course 9.11 and I'm floorin' the gas  
Gotta lotta problems, but at least one that Annette have no more  
Uh, well Dame look at how everybody changed  
Tell Jay that I'm 'bout to change the game  
Tell B.I.G. that we about to get paid  
All my niggas about to have it made  
This makes everything else sound played  
Goddamn Kanye (Kanye) Kanye!  
Now hold up  
Ain't nobody messin' with me dog  
Now you say it (ain't nobody messin' with you at all)  
I told dude ""You can't even rap on my interlude""  
Now does that make me as rude as you?  
(When the album comin' out?) Man the peoples is askin'  
Why'all don't model Adidas, just stick with the fashion  
Why'all already got do' so just spit for the passion  
The way ya rhyme give me Tribe Called Quest flashbacks  
And let's not even bring up the tracks man  
Nope, nope, let's not do that man  
You eatin' up the game like Pac-Man  
He got the whole world shakin' just like crack fangs  
  
[Chorus: Kanye West]  
Heavy hitters fo' life, Roc-a-Fella is fo' life  
Throw your diamonds up, throw your diamonds up  
Throw your diamonds  
  
Let the beat ride out for a minute  
  
[GLC (Kanye West)]  
Let's take it there, take it there man  
It's not supposed to be...  
(GLC where you at nigga?)  
  
How many niggas you know put their life on the line and get signed  
Did a few high crimes, almost got lifetime  
After the sunshine you thinkin' it might count  
How could I mic out, just look at my account  
I used to work at the mall with nothin' at all  
Seein' niggas that ball, that shit was depressin'  
Keep my clothes in the cleaners, I hate with the pressin'  
When I copied hounds it was my best investment  
Dre got shot and it taught me a lesson  
I'm stickin' niggas up and them rubbery masses  
Mash like Batman minus the tight pants  
Would hit your baby momma but her elbows is ashy  
Fo' different blues, man your outfit is crashin'  
You ain't got no muscles dude you weakling bastard  
Man look at your haircut  
Mm hmm, mm hmm, no, your hair sucks  
How many niggas you know is really heavy hitters  
'87 go getters, two hoes like John Ritter  
Even did it on his crime picture and ye  
And offers to sell and yell, uh  
  
[Chorus: Kanye West]

49443,Queen Latifah,Quiet Nights Of Quiet Stars,/q/queen+latifah/quiet+nights+of+quiet+stars_20677295.html,"Quiet nights 'n quiet stars,  
Quiet chords from my guitar  
Floating on the silence that surrounds us  
Quiet thoughts 'n quiet dreams,  
quiet walks by quiet streams  
Climbing hills where lovers go to watch the world below together  
We will live eternally in this mood of reverie  
Away . . . from all the earthly cares around us  
My world was dull each minute until I found you in it  
And all at once the happiness I knew,  
Became these quiet nights of loving you!  
  
  
[instrumental break]  
  
We will live eternally in this mood of reverie  
Away . . . from all the earthly cares around us  
My world was dull each minute until I found you in it  
And all at once the happiness I knew,  
Became these quiet nights of loving you!  
[adlib quiet nights ect.]

38454,Johnny Cash,'Cause I Love You,/j/johnny+cash/cause+i+love+you_20807684.html,"I'll sweep out your chimney  
Yes and, I will bring you flowers  
Yes and, I will do for you  
Most anything you want me to  
  
If we live in a cottage  
You will feel like it's a castle  
By the royal way you're treated  
And attention shown to you  
  
I'll be there beside you  
If you need a cryin' shoulder  
Yes, and I'll be there to listen  
When you need to talk to me  
  
When you wake up in the darkness  
I will put my arms around you  
And hold you 'til the mornin' sun  
Comes shinin' through the trees  
  
I'll be right beside you  
No matter where you travel  
I'll be there to cheer you  
'Til the sun comes shinin through  
  
If we're ever parted  
I will keep the tie that binds us  
And I'll never let it break  
'Cause I love you  
  
I will bring you honey  
From the bee tree in the meadow  
And the first time there?s a rainbow  
I'll bring you a pot of gold  
  
I'll take all your troubles  
And I'll throw 'em in the river  
Then I'll bundle down beside you  
And I'll keep you from the cold  
  
I'll be right beside you  
No matter where you travel  
I'll be there to cheer you  
Till the sun comes shinin through  
  
If we're ever parted  
I will keep the tie that binds us  
And I'll never let it break  
'Cause I love you
